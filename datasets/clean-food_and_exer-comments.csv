103,"Imeruli and Sulguni are definitely the most common used for khachapuri. If you can’t get access to those, many Georgians here will turn to mozzarella, feta, and farmer’s cheese for substitutes. You would make a mix of those for the filling— not just one (unless you wanna, be my guest LOL). My mother uses a mix of those three for her filling when she doesn’t have the time to grab some real Georgian cheese from the Russian/Eastern European shops here. There are multiple types of khachapuri. This is Adjaruli. My mother is famous for her Penovani khachapuri, which is more of a puff pastry type dough. There are other khachapuri that are flat and more similar to a pizza or a quesadilla (closest comparison I can think of in terms of appearance, not taste or texture-wise). These are Megruli and Imeruli. I could go on LOL Georgian cheese and bread is like nothing else in this world 🥰🥰🥰",1

164,Was this reverse seared?,1
165,It probably has to do with the wood. The more water content on the wood the more smoke they’ll be as a general observation.,1
166,I completely agree with your comment. But just to clarify smoke ring comes from a lack of oxygen due to the smoke creating a chemical reaction within the meat. Has nothing to do with how dirty or clean the smoke is.,1

245,"Some tips for everyone: 

Chicken breast works great here because of the lack of connective tissue. One of the few legitimate use cases for skinless boneless breast.

Pound the heck out of your chicken. It should be almost see-through. It’ll be extremely tender and fry up nice and fast, so you don’t burn the breading.

You don’t need to use super hot oil, or deep fry. Just cover the bottom of the pan with your cooking oil of choice, and bring it up to medium-low.

If you’ve got some cheese and ham, wrap the flattened chicken around that... you can make 2-3 pieces of cordon blue chicken per flattened breast.

If you’ve got left over egg/flour/crumbs... don’t throw it out, mix that ish together and fry it up.

If you have a brick of mozzarella, cut it into sticks and use it instead of chicken, just dip it in egg before the flour, and again after.",1

We mostly make it with pistachio and cream instead of almond and walnuts. And It's my first time hearing baklava with honey.",1
258,"Mastic is otherwise Mastic Gum and it is grown in Greece in the island of Chios, it seems that nowhere else in the world the trees survive which makes it very cool.  So this the resin of the trees.  Ancient Greeks actually chew on it and the first gum was made from Mastic and eventually it became what it is today.  The flavor is earthy but it has such a distinct flavor it is very hard to describe kind like pine and cedar but for some reason it is very satisfying in the pallete.  We also make a liquor out of it, Mastiha,  so you might be able to find either online but I suggest visiting a Greek restaurant that most likely carries (when time allows later on) and get a taste.  Mahlep or otherwise know Mahleb or Mahlepi is small, wild cherry pit from the St. Lucy cherry.  It is a little bitter like almond extract.  Both even though bitter give incredible aroma to this bread and the sugar offsets the bitterness so it remains a subtle aroma and taste!  I am making Tsoureki next week as both  ingredients are hard to source and delivery takes a while in the US.

279,"Yes! My mom and I make baklava literally daily. Tip is to take the filo dough out 30-45 minutes before you use it because if it's too cold, it'll be brittle and break when you try to pull out the individual sheets. Not too long or it'll dry out and give you the same problem!

We do 2 layers of filo at a time, 3 at the most if the third sheet is easier to separate. We also add a hint of rose water to the syrup we make, but you can add orange blossom water instead if you prefer.

Make sure to cut it before it goes in the oven, it's impossible without making a sad need afterwards haha

If you have any questions, feel free to message me! I have made every single mistake while making these, so I can help you avoid the pitfalls or try and recover from a mess if you've already fallen in one.

Best of luck! And don't give this out as a gift, or you'll be stuck like me and my mom making this all the time for her coworkers, parties, friends, get-well gifts...",1

488,"We found some wild ramps on a hike this morning and decided to cook them up! If you don't know what ramps are they are a sort of spring onion that grows in the eastern US. They taste like a scallion crossed with a leak crossed with a chive. The whole thing is edible you can chop of the stems and use them like a scallion or the leaves can be treated like a green. They tend to grow in patches so if you find some be sure to leave a bit of the patch behind so they will keep coming back! 

Didn't follow an exact recipe but it was more or less

- cook one big ass sweet potato until tender. 

- meanwhile wash the ramps, separate the stems and leaves, chop the stems thinly

- remove skin from cooked sweet potato and place in a food processor with 1 cup ricotta cheese, 2 ish cups flour, 1 egg, 1/2 ish cup parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and thyme. Transfer to a piping bag

- place pot of water on to boil

- start the sauce: stick of butter melted in a skillet, add to that the ramp stems, salt and pepper. Saute till the butter starts to brown then add a splash of white wine and rescue heat to low

- pipe the gnocchi into the boiling water using scissors to cut off like dumpling chunks. 

- Once they are all floating, ladle some of the water to the sauce then drain and add right to the sauce. 

- Add the ramp leaves and leave on low heat until they start to wilt. Finish with a squeeze of lemon and some more parmesan cheese",1

Within 5 minutes of walking I have two kebab shops (they sell döner, shish and other styles of kebab), Asian (Thai/Japanese/Chinese), Indian, Italian and Persian. There used to be a Syrian place that I think some refugees tried to get up and running but sadly it didn’t have much success so they shut down.

836,"Slice and brown your chorizo. If you can't find the real stuff, then use any smoked sausage and add a healthy amount of smoked paprika, oregano, garlic, and a splash of sherry vinegar. Set aside once browned (obviously, if you're using a fresh sausage, you'd have to cook it through).

Proceed as usual with standard risotto cooking instructions, adding a pinch of saffron, two sliced garlic cloves, half a cup of diced carrots, salt, and pepper. The risotto was cooked in boxed chicken broth. If you've never cooked risotto before, it's a chore but worth it. Just a lot of stirring. I used to always cook mine in a pan until I saw an Italian chef use a medium saucepan. I think a deeper pan makes a creamier risotto, but maybe that's all in my head.

When the risotto is done, add the sausage to it and some of the fat that rendered from it. Serve and sprinkle with parsley and a drizzle of olive oil. I think either red or white wine would work just fine. We had a Chilean Cabernet.

845,"This is the recipe for the dough. It’s for starter discard. 

Ingredients

1 cup (241g) sourdough starter, unfed/discard

1/2 cup (113g) warm water

2 1/2 cups (298g) All-Purpose Flour

1 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon instant or active dry yeast


Instructions

Stir any liquid on top of your refrigerated starter back into it before measuring 1 cup (241g) into a large mixing bowl. Note: This is a good opportunity to feed the remainder of your starter, if necessary.

Add the warm water, flour, salt, yeast, and Pizza Dough Flavor (if using). Mix to combine, then knead for about 7 minutes in a mixer with the dough hook, until the dough wraps itself around the hook and cleans the side of the bowl.

Place the dough in a greased container, cover and let rise until almost doubled in bulk. Depending on the vitality of your starter, this will take between 2 and 4 hours. For a faster rise, place the dough in a warm spot, or double the yeast.

For two thin-crust pizzas, divide the dough in half, and shape each into a flattened disk. Drizzle two 12"" round pizza pans with olive oil, and brush to coat the bottom. Place the dough in the pans, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes. After this rest, gently press the dough toward the edges of the pans. If it starts to shrink back, cover and let rest for 15 minutes before continuing.",1

1097,"Here’s my estimated recipe! It’s very easy but hard to master.

A good butter pie crust recipe, blind bake them for like 15 at 350f the take em out. This ensures a crisp crust on the bottom.

And then the rule with quiche is, (and it sounds like a lot but it works), 1/2 cup of heavy cream per egg. So your average pie plate it would be 3 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of cream. Some people use milk and that’s fine I guess but I find it can become gritty. Season with salt and pepper, or a dash of nutmeg for quiche florentine.

For fillings, it’s up to your imagination but you want to make sure as much moisture is taken out before it goes in the quiche. No doing so will get you a juicy quiche. It is a NOT GOOD mouth feel.

Broccoli Ham and cheese quiche (omit ham if a vegetarian):

1 1/2 cup broccoli- Bake broccoli until crisp and aldenté, give it a rough chop when it’s done.

1cup cubed ham-Cube ham and put it in a pan with a bit of oil and just keep tossing that until it’s just lightly fried and no longer moist to the touch.

As much cheese as you think, shredded- I usually just use old cheddar, this time my mom grabbed me a lil wheel of smoked cheddar and I put some of that in it was great.

Spinach quiche with caramelized onion and Swiss-

About a cup of thinly sliced onion, then caramelize in a pan with a bit of oil. Low and slow, and if they get a little dry add a teaspoon of water.

When the onion is pretty much done add a good handful or two of spinach and a tablespoon of water. Cook down until the water is basically all gone. Rough chop that.

Assembly!!!!

Put a little less than half of cheese in the bottom of crust , layer on ingredients (two forks help to spread around the spinach and onions).

Gently pour in your egg mixture so as to not push all the fillings to the sides. Careful not to get any down the side of the crust and pan as that will cause sticking.

Finish with the remainder of the cheese and bake at 350f for about 50 minutes. Then let em cool for a minute, remove by inverting on to a plate and then again to get it right side up. Cool for a little longer, then dig in!

For the fillings these are pretty loose estimates, you use whatever you want in whatever amounts you think! Please comment any questions! 🤗",1

Recipe

Ingredients

Cake:

·  1/2 cup granulated sugar

·  1/2 cup butter, room temperature

·  1 large egg

·  1 cup molasses

·  2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

·  1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

·  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

·  1 teaspoon ground cardamom

·  1 teaspoon ground ginger

·  1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

·  1/2 teaspoon salt

·  1 cup very hot black tea (recipe below)

Black tea simple syrup:

·  1 cup water

·  1 cup granulated sugar

·  2 British blend tea bags

Ginger Cream Cheese Frosting:

·  1 8 oz. pack of cream cheese, room temperature

·  6 tbsp. butter (3/4 stick), room temperature

·  2 cups confectioners’ sugar

·  2-3 teaspoons shredded ginger

·  Ground ginger, for taste

Instructions

Black tea:

Boil about 2 cups of water with three tea bags*, 3-4 whole cardamom, ground cinnamon, ground clove and a small piece of ginger. Once the tea has boiled, turn heat down to low and keep to the side.

*I like to use a strong British blend as I find it makes the cake more aromatic and truer to a masala chai.

Cake:

1.	⁠Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two 9” cake pans with cooking spray.
2.	⁠In a large mixing bowl cream together the sugar and butter until smooth and light. 
3.	⁠Add the egg and molasses and mix well. In a separate bowl mix the dry ingredients together: flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom and salt. 
4.	⁠Add dry ingredients to the wet mixture, one half at a time, and stir to combine. Slowly pour in the hot tea and stir until smooth (batter will be thin). 
5.	⁠Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. 
6.	⁠Take cakes out and let cool a bit before trying to remove them from their pans. Once ready, flip the cakes out onto a tray or sheet and let them continue to cool down.

Black tea simple syrup:

1.	⁠Add water, sugar and tea bags to a pot and heat on medium-high until all sugar has dissolved.
2.	⁠Let cool slightly and brush over cooled cakes until majority of the cake has absorbed the syrup. **Do not oversoak your cakes. You want just enough syrup to soak in that it stays moist and flavorful, but you don’t want to flood it.
3.	⁠Place cakes in fridge for about an hour or until ready to decorate.

Ginger cream cheese frosting:

1.	⁠Add cream cheese, butter, sugar and ginger to bowl and combine until light and fluffy. **I like my frosting pretty sharp from the ginger but that can be adjusted to taste preference.
2.	⁠Frost cake and enjoy!

Edit: If you’re feeling ambitious, you can also make a black tea syrup that’s very similar to the consistency of molasses and substitute that into the recipe. On medium heat bring 4 cups water, 2 cups sugar, 2-3 tea bags, spices and a teaspoon of lemon juice to a simmer. Let simmer for 45 minutes, stirring often to make sure the sugar doesn’t stick or burn. After 45 minutes, turn the heat down slightly and let simmer for an additional 15 minutes. The syrup will thicken as it cools. Strain before use and substitute 1:1 with molasses.",1

1148,"If you buy the Filou dough, only make the nut filling and Syrup and don't cut it like that but in a simple cross pattern you should be done in 30-45min. Be careful, it does taste fantastic, but if you eat more than 3 pieces you get a sugar flash (seriously that beast is like 50% sugar in the end), so it will last you a few days",1
1149,Seriously I mention how much I have missed Baklava since being diagnosed with having a certain sugar intolerant condition and a bot tells me that the name for my condition is considered derogatory. Get a fuken life.,1

1303,"I have to fess up, the almond cake was too delicate for the curd and dark chocolate glaze. I was just playing around.   
Do you have a favourite curd recipe that you can use? 

The combo could probably use a cake with the structure of say a pound cake? I haven't tried the combo that way yet but it's what comes to mind.   


The Dark Chocolate Glaze is mirror style. Another problem with the cake I used, even chilled it was very crumby (hope that makes sense). A firmer cake wouldn't have this issue, which would mean less pours of the glaze and a thinner glaze.

1315,"That’s what I keep telling my wife! She just gives me that look and goes back to her book. I mean, it’s not like I want to eat BBQ every night. One should have steak sometimes as well.",1
1316,"Lol that's one way to see it.

I mean, I usually drink Chilean or Argentinian wines, but tried Apothic a few times and it was surprisingly good for the money.

Nowadays, it's cheaper to buy South American wines in my area. Apothic here costs about USD20, while a reasonable Chilean goes for half of that",1
1317,"Mmmmmm. Wet scambies, spiral ham &amp; toast!?!...yes please! Looks delicious! Good work.",1
1318,Thanks for the response. I tend to stick with the more Americanized Asian dishes so I usually embellish General Tso's chicken or Pad Thai. I just never saw some of these ingredients before. I was going to aim for a quality pantry so thanks for the suggestions.,1

1345,L👀ks so yummy !   Bon Appetit !,1
1346,"That is a great question. From the ingredients I listed above, I would tell you that the essentials that come up often in Chinese recipes are light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, shaoxing (chinese cooking wine) wine, sesame oil, and white pepper. Things like maltose, red bean curd, and hoisin (some people use this a lot, I personally don't care for it too much, but do use it as a sub for Oyster sauce when I cook for one of my good friends who has a shellfish allergy) are not as common in the food I cook, but do show up sometimes.

Are you stocking your pantry to cook more Chinese? Thai? Korean? General Asian? I am a bit weird in that I am a white guy who is obsessed with cooking Thai and Chinese food and cook it A LOT. I have stocked my pantry with 13 different soy sauces from what I can see right now, and have multiple brands of fish sauce and other less common Southeast Asian ingredients but end up using most of these on a regular basis.

I first started out six or seven years ago only cooking Korean food, and my pantry developed from there, but it was definitely only Korean ingredients starting out!",1
1347,That's a thing of beauty.,1

1372,Looks great to me,1
1373,"Perfect, thanks! Haven’t gotten around to getting a meat thermometer yet but I think I will before trying this method, it’s been recommended to me plenty. The steak looks terrific btw",1

1384,"These look exactly like the cinnamon/cardamom buns i made at the bakery i used to work at in Scotland, down to the knotting style. Even the perforated baking sheets look the same haha",1
1386,I ended up having to put them in the broiler,1
1387,"I probably wouldn’t, but you certainly can wing it. It’s around 30 min. It just will depend on your oven and how you like your steak cooked. It makes a juicy steak even if it’s medium well. I’ve accidentally overcooked mine a couple of times that way so when it doubt go a little less in the oven. You can always sear it a little longer if you need to.",1
1388,You’re so punny. 😏😂,1
1389,"Damn, o.k, I'll search the comments again...",1
1391,Not from Mustafas in Berlin by chance?,1

1399,Looks better than the kfc version,1
1400,this sub is bout dead dinosaurs,1
1401,"Would you recommend reverse searing if you don’t have a meat thermometer? Also roughly how long was yours in the oven, just out of curiosity. Thanks!",1
1402,"Are these fresh made or the ones from Costco, they are the exact style that come in the two packs from Costco",1
1403,Fantastic,1
1404,Wheewww that looks good,1
1405,Thank you! They are perfect with milk. I put the recipe in another comment if you'd like to make the same ones we did :),1
1406,"What we do is get a bit of cling film (square ish) put it over a cup, make a little indentation, spray a bit of oil on it and crack an egg into it. Tie it up, and drop it all in boiling water for 4 minutes. Take it out, cut the cling film and voila!",1
1407,"Thanks, it was really good. :-)",1
1408,That looks like perfection in a bowl.,1
1409,"It is! It’s the traditional meal we eat on Holy Saturday night, after Christ’s resurrection at 12 at night.",1
1410,"Definitely make it if you get the chance, I've made it 3 times in two weeks 😂",1
1411,"Made with my dad!

From the back of the toll house mini chocolate chip bag:

2 1/4 cups all purpose flour  
1 tsp. baking soda  
1 tsp. salt  
1 cup (2 sticks) of softened butter  
3/4 granulated sugar  
3/4 packed brown sugar  
1 tsp. vanilla extract  
2 large eggs (we used room temperature)  
1 2/3 cups of mini chocolate chips  

Cream butter and sugars together, then add vanilla and eggs (one at a time). Mix in dry ingredients

375 degrees, 4.5 minutes, flip pan around, another 4.5 minutes

We did not add chopped nuts in cuz we didn't have any walnuts

Hopefully I didn't forget anything!",1
1412,These are beautiful! Well done!,1
1416,Nice work!......not many combos i relish more than cookies &amp; milk 😋,1
1417,"I seasoned with olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and a little red pepper and reverse seared in the oven at 275 degrees until you get an internal temp of about 110-115 depending on how you want it cooked. Remove from the oven and wrap in foil and let rest for 5-10 min. I used a cast iron to sear with vegetable oil, onion, and thyme on high heat for about 1-1:30 min per side. Just make sure the steak is thick enough. At least an inch or so if you reverse sear it",1
1418,Looks way better than the versions I had growing up in my house...,1
1419,"They look great! Do they taste *out of this world*?

... I'll see myself out.",1

1459,"The brioche is a partially whole wheat recipe I’m working and and hope to have ready to post soon.

The sirloin was salted and rested on the counter on a wire rack for 45 minutes, then grilled over a hot charcoal chimney. Rest 10 mins and slice thin against the grain. Finish with good olive oil and flaky salt. 

The horseradish sauce is grated horseradish, fresh garlic, mayo, Worcestershire, s&amp;p, and white vinegar pulsed in a food processor. Levels are to taste so some experimenting is the best way to tune yours in.",1

Amazing. Good job!",1

1507,Bravo!! Looks perfectly executed.,1
1508,Great looking food and awesome presentation 👍,1
1509,I've never had a burger this massive before and I don't plan to for a while. It was delicious but it made me feel quite guilty and overly stuffed.,1

1523,Beautifully executed!,1
1524,Rice!?,1

1529,Hey just reposted the recipe in text form below...or above...not sure which direction it is but please let me know if this satisfies everything okay bud? Want to make sure you're okay.,1
1530,Very simple.  Cut up fresh potatoes. I used russet potatoes. Then you toss them in cold water for about 10 minutes to wash out the starch. Dry them off and then fry in small batches in a cast iron skillet or some other frying pan in vegetable oil at 300f for 5 minutes. Then turn the temperature up to about 350°f and fry them all a second time for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Season them with salt or Old Bay as soon as they're out of the fryer the second time.,1
1531,"Thanks, it was the 17th of April. I just posted this really late.",1

1536,Oooooh that looks decent.,1
1537,This looks amazing! May I ask how you made them?,1
1538,"Here is the the recipe in text form for both the Fried Rice and the Char Siu - feel free to ask any questions:

**Char Siu Pork:**  
2 lb pork shoulder  
2 Tbsp soy sauce  
2 Tbsp hoisin sauce  
2 cubes red bean curd (taohu yee in Thai...don't know the Mandarin word)+ 1 Tbsp liquid  
1.25 Tbsp five spice powder  
2 Tbsp maltose  
2 Tbsp Chinese cooking wine  
½ tsp ground white pepper  
1 tsp sesame oil  
3 cloves garlic, chopped  
Glaze:  
2 Tbsp maltose  
2–3 tsp cooked leftover marinade  


\- Cut the pork shoulder, along the direction of the meat’s grain, into long strips no larger than 2-inch thick. Keep most of the fat on, but trim it if it is excessive.  
\- Mash the red bean curd until there are no more big chunks. Add all remaining ingredients (except for the glaze ingredients) and whisk until combined.  
\- Pour the marinade over the pork and make sure all pieces are coated. Marinate in the fridge for 24 hours, turning the pork half way through to ensure even distribution of marinade.  
\- When ready to roast, preheat the oven at 400°F.  
\- Line a baking sheet with foil then put a roasting rack on it. Place the pork on the rack. Roast for 15 minutes. While the pork is roasting, combine the maltose and cooked leftover marinade to make the glaze.  
\- Remove the pork after 15 minutes, brush the glaze on it (don’t worry about the bottom side), then put it back for another 5 minutes or until the glaze has dried onto the pork.  
\- Remove the pork and glaze again, then put it back in the oven for another 5 minutes.  
\- Glaze the pork again (you should glaze a total of 3 times), then roast until the pork is done. If using a thermometer, the internal temp should reach 155°F before removing from the oven.  
\- Let the pork rest for 15 minutes before slicing and eating. 

 **Char Siu Pork Fried Rice (serves 2):**  
1/2 tablespoon hot water  
1/2 teaspoon honey  
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil  
1/2 teaspoon Shaoxing wine (or dry cooking sherry)  
1/2 tablespoon soy sauce  
1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce  
1/4 teaspoon white pepper  
2.5 cups cooked Jasmine rice (add 1 teaspoon oil to rice when cooking)  
1 tablespoon oil  
1/2 medium onion (diced)  
10 ounces char siu pork  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/2 cup bean sprouts  
2 eggs (scrambled)  
2 scallions (chopped)

\- combine the hot water, honey, sesame oil, shaoxing wine, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and white pepper in a small bowl  
\- Put some oil in your wok and sauté the onions until translucent, then stir in the roast pork. Add the rice and mix well. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up. I used rice from my rice cooker, so I just stirred until combined.  
\- Add the sauce mixture and salt and mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated with sauce.   
\- Toss in your bean sprouts, scrambled eggs, and scallions. Mix thoroughly and serve!",1

Also, you already have the recipe written out. How long does copy and pasting take? The problem is you have links in it. It’s not difficult to remove the links and it surely doesn’t take 6 hours to do so. 

You just want to spam your site. So many people here asking for a recipe which is so simple for you to do but you simply won’t do it cause you’re not gonna get blog hits.

1623,"I am based in Thailand so just substitute anything you can't find with whatever you have available. Also I'm typing this on the phone, will come back and format it later on the pc.

For seasoning sauce:
Tamarind paste, palm sugar, fish sauce. Emphasis on first 2 ingredients. It should be sweet and sour, and just a little tiny hint of salt. Ratio will depend on how sour the tamarind paste is, so taste and adjust. Bring to boil on stove until palm sugar is dissolved and set aside. Can be stored in freezer.

Ingredients:
Rice noodles
Hard tofu
Dried shrimp, medium size (about 1cm)
Fresh shrimp/river prawn (optional, can also sub with squid, or use both and make a seafood pad thai)
Chinese pickled radish
Eggs
Bean sprouts
Seasoning sauce

Garnish:
Chives
Banana flower (optional)
Crushed peanuts, toasted and unsalted (or almonds/cashews/etc.)
Chilli flakes (optional)
Lime

Directions:
- stir fry diced/julienned tofu, minced Chinese pickled radish, dried shrimp, and set aside.
- same pan on high heat, a bit of oil, put noodles and bean sprouts on. If using dried noodles put a little bit of water to make steam and cover for a minute to soften the noodles. If fresh, stir fry a bit to coat the noodles in oil.
- push noodles to one side, crack in an egg and beat it in the pan. When it starts to cook, flip the noodles over the egg and stir fry.
- add tofu, dried shrimps, and fresh ingredients and 2-3 tablespoons of seasoning sauce and stir fry. Taste and add more seasoning if needed. It should not taste overwhelmingly sweet or sour.
- plate and serve with garnish.",1

1692,Thank You!,1
1693,"Oh geez... I don’t really measure things out but I can give you an estimate. Preset oven to 375F (little hot for the chicken little cool for the pot). The potato, washed russet, sliced almost through (hasselback style) and then just a bit of oil salt and pepper and on a rack in the oven. Once the potato has cooked for about a half hour I start to brush softened or melted butter on it and try to get it in the cracks, do this a couple times and it should take 1 hour or so total to cook, throw the cheese on right before you take it out and garnish how you want (I went with sour cream and green onion). 

Chicken, just a whole leg skin on, pat dry and I score the skin a bit, just like two slices. The seasoning was a tbsp of garlic powder, tbsp of Lawry’s seasoning salt, a tbsp or chopped rosemary, tsp of oregano and parsley, some black pepper. Use a bit of oil to get the seasoning to stick, throw on a flat baking sheet and tent/loosely wrap with tin foil. Bake for about 30 minutes and then remove the tin foil, and baste with juices. Now every time I butter the potatoes I also spoon juices back onto the chicken, the chicken takes about 50 minutes and I like to cook it uncovered for at least 20 to brown the skin. Broil if needed to get extra crispy.",1

1853,"Had some potatoes, onions, bread crumbs and eggs so I thought I’d give the Basics with Babish latke recipe a go.  The oil got a bit to hot so they got burnt around the edges, but we’re perfect on the inside.  

I probably should have taken the picture before I ate the more photogenic ones, lol.",1
1855,"Recipe:

1 pound ground beef (I used 90%)

1 pound ground pork

2 eggs, lightly beaten

1/4 cup finely grated pecorino romano cheese

1 cup breadcrumbs made from stale onion sourdough that I pulsed in the food processor. 

½ a tbs kosher salt

1 tsp oregano

2 tbs fresh minced parsley

1 tbs grated fresh garlic

1 tsp onion powder

½ tsp red pepper flakes

½ tsp thyme

1/3 cup whole milk

Pour the milk over the bread and let it sit for a few minutes. 

In a large bowl, mixed the meat with the grated cheese, herbs, salt, pepper, and eggs. Mixed in the bread and milk mixture and the tbs of olive oil. Mix thoroughly until the texture is uniform and will hold its shape. Form into 12-16 large meatballs. Cook at 415F for approximately 20 minutes (until 160F in the center). 

For the sauce with the mushrooms:

2 tbs butter

1 pint crimini mushrooms, quartered

4 cloves of grated garlic

1 large shallot

1 tsp oregano

¼ cup tomato paste

2 large cans crushed tomatoes (28 oz each)

salt to taste (I used around half a tsp, I guess)

1 tbs good extra virgin olive oil

½ cup red wine

Heat the butter in a large saute pan until foamy. Add the mushrooms and do not move them. Let them brown for a few minutes on medium-high to high heat. This helps them develop a bit of a crust. Toss them in the pan and let them continue browning. After a few more minutes, lower the heat and add the shallot and garlic. Sweat them for a few minutes and then deglaze the pan with the wine. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, herbs, and salt. Cook for about 20 minutes until all the flavors meld. Finish by stirring the olive oil into the sauce. 

Cook your spaghetti while you’re making the sauce—it takes about 10 minutes. Reserve ½ cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce with the pasta water. Over low heat, just toss it all together and the sauce is shiny and it all looks delicious and the pasta is coated. Serve with the meatballs on top and a finishing of cheese and fresh basil.",1

1860,"RECIPE

Ingredients:

- 2 cups sugar (400 grams)
- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (210 grams)
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder + 2 tablespoons (75 grams)
- 2 teaspoons baking soda (12 grams)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder (4 grams)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt (6 grams)
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup buttermilk (240mL)
- 1 cup coffee [Although tea was used instead] (240mL)
- 1/2 cup coconut oil (120mL)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract (4 grams)


DIRECTIONS

1. Heat oven to 350F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans. Set aside
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or in large bowl with electric mixer, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Mix on low until dry ingredients are thoroughly combined.

2. Add eggs, buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla. Beat on medium speed for about two minutes, the batter will be thin.

3. Pour batter evenly into prepared pans.

4. Bake in preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until wooden toothpick come out clean.

5. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks. Cool completely.

CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM/GANACHE 

Icing is eyeballed and the exact recipe is unknown.

FOR 2 layer 9 inch round cake
 
- 3/4 cups unsalted butter.
- Start off with one cup of icing sugar
- 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons cocoa powder 
- 1 tbsp milk
- 1 teaspoon instant coffee.

Start by mixing the butter with the sugar until it's creamed.
Then add the cocoa powder until it's creamed. You may adjust the levels of the cocoa powder to your preference of sweetness and chocolate i-ness. 
At this point adjust your icing sugar if you need to add more. You'll most likely need 1/2 cup more added in.
You may also need to add a few more tablespoons of milk to make it smooth and airy. Beat it until it's super smooth and light. Mix the instant coffee with few drops of water to dissolve the crystals, and then and it to the mixture.
Frost the cake how you like. My sister used chocolates found in the house.",1

1915,"So this was a food experiment I undertook. I had tried in the past to make flatbreads using potato flour sold at bulk stores and found they don't bind when heated. After watching some videos on the science of potatoes, and what different varieties of potatoes were good for, it dawned on me that most commercial potato flour is made from floury potatoes. Without getting to nerdy about why this matters for binding, these potatoes have a very different starch composition than waxy varieties such as reds.

I realized the only way I could make a flatbread with 100% potato flour was to make my own potato flour, and only make it from waxy potatoes. I chose red potatoes because they have the best possible binding properties during cooking.

So, I sliced up a whole bag of red potatoes on a mandolin, dehydrated the slices, and ground them into a fine powder. From there, I made a batter out of the potato flour, a little salt, spices, and enough water to make it slightly thinner that pancake batter. I decided to ferment the batter, but after learning potatoes to don't easily ferment without the addition of other ingredients, I added white sugar to kick start fermentation.

After four days of fermentation, I cooked the batter on a crepe maker. It took a bit of trial and error to figure out a technique for cooking that worked. What ended up working was setting the cooktop to medium heat, pouring 1/4 cup of the batter on it, quickly thinning the batter mound to about tortilla thickness, and then popping a lid over it. Once the surface of the flatbread looked dry and solid, I removed the lid and gave the flatbread a minute or so longer until the edge were very slightly raised. I should point out, ever so slightly. The edges shouldn't curl up, but it shouldn't look like the batter is 'gripping' to cooking surface. Once the edges were just right, then the challenge was removing the very sticky flatbread from the surface. I should point out that this was a non-stick surface, but it still stuck. I learned you have to very slowly and carefully loosen the item with a thin plastic server, making sure to push down with the server as you go. Each flatbread took at least 20 seconds to get off the cooktop, which should give perspective over how long and hard removing these can be. When I managed to remove it, I noticed there was a sticky side and a dry side. I decided it was best to have them cool sticky side-up on one place, and as they cooled, move them to another plate dry side-up.

When I was done cooking the batter, I was a bit disappointed with the sticky side. It was giving them a slightly unpleasant consistency on the bottom. To fix that, I put them all on a pan with the sticky side up and under a broiler for 5 minutes. This dried the sticky side, and make them very nice throughout.",1

**TIP:**

To assure that your buttercream does not separate make sure your raspberries are at room temperature! If they are fresh out of the fridge, the juice won’t combine with the butter at all!

* 1/4 cup salted butter (60g)
* 3/4 cup powdered sugar (75 g)
* 1 cup (150 g) fresh raspberries, worked through a sieve to extract 3 tbsp of juice  


1. Whip butter with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Slowly add sugar. Then place sieve on top of a bowl the same size. Work raspberries through the sieve with a spatula, pushing them through, mashing them around until you extract their juice. You want 3 tablespoons of juice.
2. Add juice to buttercream, and whip until combined.",1

1/2 cup ketchup

3 tablespoons brown sugar

1/4 cup rice vinegar

1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil

2 teaspoons cornstarch

2 tablespoons sesame seeds

2 tablespoons sliced green onions

Steps

Place the eggs, salt and pepper in a bowl. Stir to combine

**Method**

1. Marinate the chicken in the Dahi and spices for the marinade. Keep it aside

6. Then add the chopped onions and cook again till nutty (slightly brown) 
7. Add the powdered spices in the sequence listed above, cooking for a while in between. Then add a splash of water to homogenize the mixture
8. Add the chopped tomatoes. Cover and cook till the tomatoes are soft and mushy. (I stir the pot once Ina while)
9. Add the chicken marinade mixture and the rest of the ghee (clarified butter). Cook till the Dahi (yogurt) is cooked (oil/fat separates) 
10. Add water as required. Cook covered on medium low till the chicken is tender. 
Garnish with coriander. Serve with rice or chapati",1

*What you need*

Chicken, (or a chicken substitute I've tried to do it with cauliflower before for a veggie mate who enjoyed it)

Egg (optional I don't personally use it but it can be useful) 

Buttermilk

Siracha 

Garlic (powdered or crushed its up to you) 

Mixed Herbs, spices (optional over all but I do recommend at least having paprika and cilantro) 

And the best ingredient, Doritos hot 

*instructions*


like Bob Ross said there are no mistakes only happy accidents so don't worry about measurements 

- Mix buttermilk and siracha to a ratio you enjoy 

- cut whatever you are deep frying to the size you want, which can be strips, chunks 

- *optional* add herbs and spices of your choice to the crushed doritos

- take your bag of doritos and crush them to a nice crunchy amount (try not to crush them to the level of a powder unless that's what you want

- Take your chicken or alternative and slaver that son of a bish in the buttermilk/siracha mix 

- leave it for half an hour to an hour in the fridge 

- remove and dunk in the crushed doritos 

- dunk again in buttermilk mix and then into the doritos making sure you get a nice coating

- place in fridge again for half an hour to an hour 

- deep fry until cooked

-once done place on tissue paper to absorb the oil and cool for a couple of mins 

- final step is serve and eat",1

2047,As the other commenter said macarons have to be precise. With a food scale and following the steps what I thought was perfectly it took me a few tries to get them right. You will definitely need an oven thermometer as well being off a few degrees can make the macarons deflate or not rise properly. They are a pain to get right but the pay off is worth it.,1

2053,"Please watch the video carefully, as there's lots of technique in there which will get you all the tiny crunchy bits. :)  

* Brine  2 cups of buttermilk 2 Tablespoons of COOKING SALT or KOSHER SALT if you use a fine grain salt like table salt, reduce amount by one quarter OR IT WILL BE TOO SALTY! Brine for 24 hours if possible but minimum overnight if you can. I've done a 3-4 hours and it's still been good. .   
Dredge  
* 1.5 cups of flour 
* 0.5 cup of cornflour 
* 1 Tablespoon of smoked paprika. The one that smells like bacon. 
* 1 Tablespoon of chicken stock. I use Vegeta chicken stock 
* 1 Tablespoon of Mexican Chilli aka chili powder. DO NOT USE CHILLI PEPPER POWDER UNLESS YOU LIKE IT HOT!!! 
* 2 teaspoons of cooking salt or chicken salt, if available 
* 1 teaspoon of black pepper 
* 1 teaspoon of garlic powder NOT GARLIC SALT OR IT WILL BE TOO SALTY! 
* 1 teaspoon of onion powder NOT ONION SALT OR IT WILL BE TOO SALTY! 
* 1 teaspoon cayenne powder 
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder  

&amp;#x200B;

* Oil  I use peanut oil or lard but many are using rice bran and vegetable. Just watch with canola, as you can get a fishy smell.  The recipe will usually do 4-6 decent sized chicken thighs before either the dredge gets too crusty or the buttermilk thins out overnight.

2138,"*For the carrots:*

-Wash five pounds of carrots and four quart jar

Cut the carrots into quarters and wash, then boil in a stock pot for five minutes before straining and cooling under cold water

Put 2 tbsp mustard seed, 1 tbsp black peppercorn, one cinnamon stick and a medium-large clove of garlic in each jar, before packing with carrots. (All your carrots should fit in the jars. If not, feel free to use a fifth.)

-Mix four cups of white vinegar, one cup of apple cider vinegar, two cups of sugar and three cups of water in a pot and bring to a boil, then pour into the packed jars, leaving 1/2 inch of headroom

-Heat jar lids at a light boil for ten minutes and place on thw jars using a magnetic lid wand, screw bands on jars and leave them finger-tight

-Bring waterbath canner to a boil. Ensure there is enough water to sit 1 inch above the lids. Place jars in the water and wait till the water is at a rolling boil again, then carefully extract the jars and gently place on a dishtowel on the counter, and let the jars cool completely. The lids will pop loudly when they seal. Do not touch them until they are room temperature though.

*For the dill pickles there was no specific recipe followed, so here is what I did.*

-Wash and quarter small cucumbers

-Pour mustard seed, celery seed, black pepper corn, and salt into jars

-Pack the jars with the cucmbers and stuff dill sprigs into the sides (2-3 sprigs per jar)

-Bring a mixture of 2 cups apple cider vinegar, 1 cup water and 1/4 cup salt to a boil and fill jars until there is 1/2 inch of headroom

-simmer lids for ten minutes and place them on jars, screwing the bands down finger tight

-Bring water bath canner to a boil, with enough water to submerge jars by 1 inch

-Process jars until the water is at a rolling boil again, then carefully extract and gently place on a dishtowel. Leave until the jars are sealed and at room temperature

I separated the batter into 3 bowls and added gel coloring to each. I then finished mixing to the lava stage and filled the piping bag rotating scoops of each color.

2294,"For the calcio e pepe, I followed Andy from the Bon Appetit Test Kitchen's recipe: 
Thinly slice 1/2 to 3/4 of a lemon. Caramelise the lemons over browning butter, save some for plating. Put in the pasta and pour in pasta water plus parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce. Add lots of freshly ground black pepper and season accordingly. Top with more fresh parm to serve.

To make pickled red onions:
Thinly slice a medium red onion and place in jar/mug. In a saucepan, combine two parts water, one part honey, one part vinegar, salt, and red pepper flakes. Heat until simmering. Taste and season accordingly(it should be fairly acidic, but not to the point of unpalatable). Pour over red onions and pickle for 30minutes or until cooled.

For the chicken piccata:
Butterfly the chicken breast and cut into two slices and pound them. Dredge them on flour and fry in neutral oil, 3 minutes a side(flavor the flour with salt and pepper if you want). Take out the chicken, and make a reux by adding equal parts butter and flour. After browning, deglaze the mixture with chicken stock and 2 tbspoon lemon juice. Add in capers if you have, I used pickled red onions. Then add in 2 tbsp heavy cream and chopped parsley, and put the chicken back to coat thoroughly.",1

2562,"I reformatted op's recipe from another comment to make it a little easier to read:

*for the galaxy mix instead of adding the gel coloring after the sugar, I waited until I had just stirred in the last 1/3 of the almond flour/sugar mix but had not reached the lava stage. I separated the batter into 3 bowls and added gel coloring to each. I then finished mixing to the lava stage and filled the piping bag rotating scoops of each color.

##Macarons recipe

###Ingredients 

125 grams – almond flour 

125 grams – powdered sugar 

100 grams – white sugar 

100 grams – aged egg whites 

¼ teaspoon cream of tartar 

GEL color of your choice

###Supplies 

Scale Stand mixer 

2 - ½ sheet pans 

2 - Silpats 

Spatula 

16 inch piping bag with round tip 

Lemon juice

###Instructions 

• Age egg white 24 hours prior to making macarons 

• Bring aged egg whites to room temperature 

• Process the almond flour to make sure it’s finely ground 

• Sift almond flour and powdered sugar together 

• Wipe down mixing bowl, spatula, and whisk with lemon juice 

• Put room temperature egg white into mixing bowl and whip until foamy 

• Add cream of tartar to foamy eggs 

• Whip egg white until whisk starts to leave trails in the egg whites 

• Add 1/3 white sugar and whip to incorporate, continue to add sugar 1/3 at a time until it’s fully incorporated 

• Add gel food coloring 

• Whip until stiff peaks 

• Sprinkle 1/3 of the almond flour/powdered sugar mixture onto the eggs white 

• Fold into the egg white until fully incorporated 

• Repeat 1/3 until all almond flour /powder sugar is incorporated 

• Fold the batter till it reaches a lava/honey consistency and passes the figure 8 test 

• Fill piping bag with batter 

• Pipe macarons onto silpats 

• Tap finished tray to release any air bubbles 

• Use a toothpick to pop any additional bubbles 

• Let macarons rest to form skin (30ish mins until you can touch the macarons with no transfer) 

• Preheat oven to 310 

• Bake macarons until done (should be able to life the macarons fully off the silpat with little/no sticking) 18+ mins – only bake 1 tray at a time 

• Cool on cooling racks 

• Once they reach room temperature you can fill and sandwich them 

• Mature in the fridge for 24 hours",1

2671,"I followed the Ranveer Brar's chicken curry recipe (YouTube) 

Ingredients 
For the marinade - 

Dahi (yogurt), beaten - 1/2 cup 
Green chillies- 2 or 3 (Serrano: less hot, Thai: hotter) 
Salt - as per taste
Turmeric - 1/2 tsp 
Red chilli powder - 1 tsp (preferable to use a mixture of cayenne and paprika) 
Dhaniya (Coriander) powder - 1 tsp 
Elaichi (Cardamom) green - 2 pieces
Laung (Cloves) - 2 pieces 

For the curry- 

Chicken - 750g (I used bone in legs, cut up into pieces) 
Onions - 5 to 6 medium size (preferably use red or purple)
Tomato - 2 medium size
Garlic - 6 to 7 cloves 
Ginger - half the amount of garlic
Fresh Dhaniya (Coriander) - few sprigs for garnish

Whole Spices 
Elaichi (Cardamom) black - 1 crushed 
Tej Patta (Bay leaf) - 2 large (3-4 small)
Jeera (Cumin seeds) - 1 tsp
Laung (Cloves) - 2 pieces

Spice powders 
Turmeric - 1/4 tsp 
Salt - as per taste 
Dhaniya (Coriander) powder - 1.5 tsp
Red chilli powder - 1 tsp 

Ghee (clarified butter) - 3 tbsp 
Oil - 1/2 tbsp (preferably use vegetable/peanut/sunflower/canola oil) 
Water - as required
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Method 

1. Marinate the chicken in the Dahi and spices for the marinade. Keep it aside 
2. Chop the onions, garlic, ginger and tomatoes. Keep in mind not to chop them too finely. 
3. Heat oil and 1tbsp ghee (clarified butter) in a thick bottomed pan on medium heat (I used a Dutch oven) 
4. Add the whole spices for the curry and cook till fragrant (20-30 seconds)
5. Add the ginger and garlic, and cook till slightly brown (30-40 seconds)
6. Then add the chopped onions and cook again till nutty (slightly brown) 
7. Add the powdered spices in the sequence listed above, cooking for a while in between. Then add a splash of water to homogenize the mixture
8. Add the chopped tomatoes. Cover and cook till the tomatoes are soft and mushy. (I stir the pot once Ina while)
9. Add the chicken marinade mixture and the rest of the ghee (clarified butter). Cook till the Dahi (yogurt) is cooked (oil/fat separates) 
10. Add water as required. Cook covered on medium low till the chicken is tender. 
Garnish with coriander. Serve with rice or chapati",1

2674,"https://www.ricardocuisine.com/en/recipes/5812-beef-tartare-the-best

Didn't have Sambal Oelek, and I added a jalapeño pepper and homemade hot sauce.

I also made ""French mayonnaise"", which is basically regular Hellmann's, but with 1/10 of the volume of Dijon mustard.",1
2675,"I saw that some of you asked for a recipe so here you go:

ingredients:

* 100% strong flour (US bread flour or &gt;350W 0.6 P/L)
* 30% water
* 30% milk
* 11% white sugar
* 2% salt
* 2% diastatic malt powder
* 4% fresh yeast
* 50% butter with &gt;= 82% fat - for lamination
* egg wash (1 egg white + 1/2 egg yolk + a splash of water + a pinch of salt)

mix the ingredients except the butter and knead them until windowpaning. Shape the dough to a rectangle, wrap it in chellophane and place it in the coldest part of the fridge for 12h.

Form the butterblock by rolling the butter in between a folded piece of parchment paper in a thin (2,5 mm) even rectangular slab with the rolling pin. Place it in the top rack of the fridge.

After the 12h elapse take out the dough, flatten it in a rectangle wide as the butterblock and twice as long. Encase the butter and tap on top with the rolling pin to make the butter stick to the dough. Roll it out to 5/6mm, cut the end pieces until you see the butter and do a double turn. Cut a shallow slit where the dough bend. rest it in the freezer for 20min.   
With the fold on you right roll out the dough again and do a simple turn, cut the slits and let it rest in the fridge for 40/60 min.

With the fold in front of you start to rolling the dough to the height of the croissant triangle you want + 2 cm for edge trimming (I make 9cm x 26cm triangles). Rotate the dough 90 degree and finally roll it the until you achieve a thickness of 3,5 mm. Wait 5 min. trim 1 cm form every edges, mark your triangles and with a sharp knife cut them. Place them in a baking sheet cover with cellophane and let them rest in the fridge 20 min to cool a bit.

shape you croissant by holding them by the base with one hand and give them a light stretch with the other. Roll them fairly tight with the point underneath and let them proof for 2,5/3 hours, or until doubled in size, in a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and covered with plastic. The ideal temperature for this stage in 25C. If you exceed 28C butter will probably melt.

When proofed preheat the oven to 200C conventional (180 Convection), give the a egg wash and bake them for \~20 min, lowering the temperature by 10 degree if they darken to much. Cool them on a rack.

&amp;#x200B;

its imperative to keep everything cold during lamination. If at anytime the dough exceed 14/15 degree you should stop and place it in the freezer tightly wrapped in plastic for 15 min. Also the consistency in the thickness of the dough is of extreme importance.   
Its really difficult to explain the procedure by text, you should watch some videos on croissants making to see the process, how they manipulate the dough and how they shape the croissant.",1

1. Peel and finely dice one small onion. Prepare the chicken by cutting into even-sized strips, then cut each strip into bite-sized pieces. Set aside while you prepare the eggs.  

2. Place a medium bowl onto a scale. Crack in your eggs and take note of the weight. Based on the total weight of the eggs, add in 10% of that weight in BOTH milk and cream (e.g. for 500g of eggs, add in 50g of milk and 50g of cream). Whisk until well combined, then sieve the egg mixture into another bowl and allow to rest for 10 minutes.  

*NOTE: Allowing the eggs to rest is important as this will give us time for all the air bubbles that were created during the whisking to dissipate. You want this to happen as the air bubbles trapped in the eggs create a vacuum, causing heat to rush in and will make your eggs cook faster.*  

3. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add 3tbsp of vegetable oil until shimmering. Add chicken to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until the chicken is halfway cooked. Add the onions and cook for an additional 2 minutes or until they become translucent.  

4. Add the cooked rice to the pan and begin breaking the clumps to separate the grains of rice. Mix this evenly to ensure all the rice is coated in oil, adding additional oil if the rice looks dry in any areas. Add the soy sauce and ketchup and thoroughly mix to coat everything in the pan. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, turn off the heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes before handling.  

5. Scoop the fried rice into a small bowl and invert this onto your desired serving plate. Remove the bowl and then shape this dome of rice into a teardrop shape.   

Taper the thinner end of the teardrop downwards towards the base of the plate. With additional rice, make two small teardrops and place one on either side of the body to make flippers. For the tail, again, take additional rice and form this into a crescent moon shape.  

6. Make the seals' face by placing two green peas into the larger end of the body to make eyes, and one pea in the centre below the eyes for the nose. Place your seaweed below the eyes to create whiskers. Place this in a warm oven while you make the omelette.   

7. In a small frying pan over medium heat, add 2 tsp of oil. When the oil is heated, pour in 1.5 to 2 ladles of the egg mixture.   

When you see the eggs begin to set around the edges, use a gentle pushing/pulling motion to bring this into the centre of the pan.

The uncooked eggs will rush back into the area where you just dragged from, that's perfect.   Continue this process until the eggs form one cohesive mass, they're set at the bottom but you still have a wet-looking top (if you're concerned about this, the residual heat of the eggs will continue cooking the wet bits, but you can leave it in the pan for an additional minute if desired).   

Immediately drape the eggs over your fried rice.  

8. Finish plating by adding a drizzle of ketchup over the omelette and garnish with your side salad if desired. Enjoy!",1

- Swedish cinnamon buns

1040g AP Flour
75g Baking Powder
5g Baking Soda
25g Salt

Whisk together dry ingredients

330g (3 sticks) Butter, cold, diced small

Add the butter and dry ingredients together in a stand mixer. With the paddle attachment, mix at low speed until no clumps of butter remain.

Fresh herbs, bacon, cheese, other veg

If you want to jooz it up a bit add some flavourful mix-ins at this point. I like to do Jalapeño Cheddar Bacon biscuits. (226g cheese, 226g bacon, 2 jalapeños brunoise and lightly roasted)

3 1/2 cups buttermilk

Pour into the butter/flour mixture all at once and paddle until the dough comes together.

Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface and roll to approximately 1/2"" thick. Cut them into shape. (I prefer squares because it reduces waste but any shape will do)

Place the biscuits you plan to bake now in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Freeze the rest, separating the layers of biscuit with parchment paper.

Preheat your oven to 350°F

Lay the biscuits out on a well greased sheet pan in a single layer. Bake approximately 15 minutes until the tops are golden brown. Brush with butter right out of the oven and enjoy!",1

3236,"Ingredients

5 tbsp olive oil

2 eggs lightly beaten

3 tbsp cornflour/cornstarch

10 tbsp plain/all-purpose flour

½ tsp salt

½ tsp pepper

½ tsp garlic salt

2 tsp paprika
3 chicken breast fillets chopped into bite-size chunks

Sauce: *

1 tbsp sesame oil optional - you can leave out and just sprinkle with plenty of sesame seeds at the end if you prefer

2 cloves garlic peeled and minced

1 tbsp Chinese rice vinegar white wine vinegar will work too

2 tbsp honey

2 tbsp sweet chilli sauce use more or less depending on the brand and how spicy you like it

3 tbsp ketchup

2 tbsp brown sugar

4 tbsp soy sauce

To Serve:

Boiled rice
2 tbsp sesame seeds

Small bunch spring onions/scallionschopped
 
  
  
Instructions

Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan until very hot.

Whilst the oil is heating, place the egg in one shallow bowl and the cornflour in another shallow bowl. Add the flour, salt, pepper, garlic salt and paprika to another shallow bowl and mix together.

Dredge the chicken in the cornflour, then dip in the egg (make sure all of the chicken is covered in egg wash), and finally dredge it in the seasoned flour. Add to the wok and cook on a high heat for 6-7 minutes, turning two or three times during cooking, until well browned. You may need to cook in two batches (I find I can do it in one batch so long as it's no more than 3 chicken breasts). Remove from the pan and place in a bowl lined with kitchen towels.

Add all of the sauce ingredients to the hot wok, stir and bubble on a high heat until the sauce reduces by about a third (should take 2-3 minutes). Add the chicken back in and toss in the sauce to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes.

Turn off the heat and divide between four bowls. Serve with boiled rice and top with sesame seeds and spring onions.",1

Hopefully, you can get some of the clean flavored yeast to take hold in the starter without totally overwhelming the natural microbes. Repeating at each feeding will (hopefully) gradually transition from very sour to quite clean. 

I used to make bread using leftover brewing yeast and in spite of the fact that it was kept as a starter and made with sourdough processes it was very nuetral. So, all depends on what specific yeast/bacteria are in your starter.",1

3346,"It's very basic:  
31 grams of AP flour, 
1 cup or 122 grams of confectioners sugar , 
1 stick or 1/2 cup of unsalted butter,
6 oz semisweet baking chocolate,
2 eggs plus 2 yolks,
Pinch of salt

Preheat your oven to 450F. Use a whisk to mix the confectioners sugar and flour, that will make it easier to incorporate with the wet ingredients later. 

Rough chop the chocolate and melt it with the butter in 10 second increments in the microwave until the chocolate is almost completely melted. Stir it with a spatula to finish melting the chocolate. Coming out of the microwave the chocolate's temperature is going to continue to rise just a tiny bit so you can finish melting the chocolate by stirring it and that way your chocolate is cool enough to mix with the eggs without cooking them. 

Beat the 2 eggs and 2 yolks together then mix them into the chocolate and then mix the flour and confectioners sugar into the chocolate. The batter will be thick but not lumpy, should pour right out of the center of your whisk instead of lumping.

Now, grease 3 ramikins or 6 muffin cups in a tray and then powder them with cocoa powder. Turn the tray upside down and tamp off the excess powder before spooning the batter into the cups or ramikins. 10 minutes in the center of your oven should do it. The tops will look really soft and maybe even a little wet. I let mine rest for a minute before turning them over onto a cookie sheet and powdering with confectioner's sugar through a sieve.

I know I made it wordy but this is really easy enough to do while you're finishing dinner.",1

Sear in a large pot in hot oil to ensure healthy crust. After crust is achieved we added cut carrots, sweet potato, Brussel sprouts, pineapple, and red bell pepper to the same pot as the beef. Sauté vegetables with salt and pepper on high heat until they start to char and add in aromatics of grated ginger, garlic, and a spoonful of green curry paste. Cook out the aromatics and add in one can of coconut milk, half a cup of chicken or vegetable stock, a small amount of gochujang and rice vinegar. Cover pot and allow to simmer for 10 minutes, removing beef and slicing for serving before adding back into simmering curry. Serve with rice and naan bread! Glad you enjoy 😁",1
3383,"**For the dough:**

* 300 g 2 cups +1/4 cup bread flour
* 45 g 3 tbsp. granulated sugar
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 4 g 1 +1/2 tsp. instant yeast
* 30 g 2 tbsp. egg liquid

Speed up the stand mixer and knead another 10 minutes until the dough becomes quite elastic.
2. Place the dough in a warm place, covered and wait until at least 2 times in size.

**Crust topping**

1. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to cream the softened butter until smooth. Add sugar and continue to beat until fluffy. Mix egg liquid and shift cake flour. Mix everything well.

2. Divide the crust dough into 8 portions too. Roll each one to a round wrapper. The wrapper can be a slightly sticky and you can roll it with the help of plastic wrappers. Place one wrapper on the board, then flat the crust portion, cover with another plastic wrapper.
3. Cover the crust over the bun (from the top side).
4. Add some cuts for a lovely appearance.

1/2 Cup Brown Sugar  
100g Butter

75g Butter  
1/2 Cup Golden Syrup

Topping  
2 Cups Roasted Peanuts

Icing  
250g dark chocolate

Pour the caramel over the cooked base and bake again for 10- 15 minutes in the oven. Take out and while the caramel is still hot sprinkle the peanuts on the top evenly.  
Allow to cool before icing.

Icing: Chop the Chocolate into small pieces and melt this with the cream over low heat. Mix until smooth and all chocolate has melted then our over the peanuts.

Refrigerate until the chocolate has set. Cut into slices using a hot knife.

3757,Underside didn't brown much without the stone but the outer crust was tasty,1
3758,I would love to see the inside of this cake.,1
3759,"Just a thought. Rather than biscuits, what about pie crust discs? I’m used to microwave pot pies, and the occasional from KFC, but this soup looks delicious. That said, my mind finds it incomplete without some flaky pie crust in that gravy, and I think miniature pie crust tops would be perfect here.",1

3770,"It’s really tasty, it’s sweet but spicy. There’s fish cake and spring onions in it. I’ve added bacon and a boiled egg with runny yolk for added flavours. 

I’ve been wanting to try making this for awhile now since it’s one of my favourite dishes that I always order out. This lockdown has given me a reason to. Gotta curb that craving some how!",1
3771,"Don’t have a link, it’s kind of an evolved creation from an idea my husband found online in college. It used to just be chorizo mixed in boxed Velveeta shells and cheese with mushrooms and chopped zucchini. 

Now it’s:
- chorizo          
- olive oil           
- chopped green peppers        
- chopped onions       
- chopped mushrooms        
- sweet corn         
- zucchini (when available, it wasn’t for today)           
- egg noodles (rotini is also a good alternative)          
- 2 beef bullion cubes               
- Mexican blend of shredded cheeses (this is queso, Monterey Jack, asadero, and cheddar)             
- garlic salt            
- pepper               
- sugar (not necessary if you’re fine with heat)          

1. Put water, 2 beef bullion cubes, and garlic salt in a pot. Boil, and add noodles. Cook to desired consistency, drain, and then set to the side.          
2. Put **just enough olive oil to coat the bottom** in a deeper frying pan.         
3. Put onions and peppers into the pan for 2-3 minutes on a high heat.         
4.  Add zucchini.          
5.  Add mushrooms and corn and cook until mostly done.           
6.  Add chorizo and break it up in the pan.          
7.  Sprinkle with garlic salt and pepper.         
8.  I personally add a small pinch of sugar over the meat because some people in my house are sensitive to spicy food and the sugar helps cut that down a lot.           I prefer it at full heat, myself.            
9. Turn down the temperature to medium, and just keep it moving until the chorizo is cooked (usually 5 minutes or so.        
10. Drain the grease from the pan.          
11.  Mix chorizo and veggies into a large serving bowl with the noodles.           
12. Mix in cheese until it reaches your desired consistency. I like mine super cheesy so it usually takes a full large bag to get me there, my husband prefers it less cheesy so that’s just personal preference.",1
3772,Thanks! It tasted great and the olive tapenade really added a nice note.,1

3788,Recipe plz man,1
3789,"So I dont measure things unfortunately lol but I used a 15oz can of salmon, diced carrots, peppers, onions, celery, minced fresh garlic, mayo, 2 eggs, parmesan panko bread crumbs, dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, old bay, smoked paprika, and lemon juice.  The key is to make sure there's enough moisture and it's not too dry, dry makes it crumbly.  My mixture was about the moisture of tuna salad more or less.  I started with the salmon, added the veggies and garlic til it looked like a good ratio, then added maybe a tablespoon dijon, tablespoon Worcestershire, tablespoon or more of hot sauce, a tablespoon or two of old bay, maybe a teaspoon of smoked paprika, half a lemon juice, then added the mayo and eggs and added the break crumbs til it was the right consistency.  I hope that helps!",1

3850,"I didn’t really use a recipe, but it was kinda like...

1-2 tbsp grated ginger and garlic
1/4 c diced white onion
2 tsp Thai red curry paste
1 tsp powdered lemongrass 

Sweat all that in some olive oil on med/low depending on how hot your stove gets.  I used a really heavy enamel pot.  

After the onions are soft and it’s smelling pretty good (~5 min), I added about 3 cups of veggie broth and like 1/2 tbsp salt.  Bring to boil.

Once boiling, I added 3 medium sized cubed/peeled potatoes and 1 really big peeled and half-moon cut carrot.  Simmered that til soft, about 20 min.

Then I added 2 cans lite coconut milk, whisked it up to break up clumps.   Then added about 1/2 a red pepper cut into small strips and 8-9 sliced baby Bella mushrooms, juice and zest of a lime, and a splash of fish sauce.  Cooked it maybe 10 more min on low.  Served with green onions and cilantro on top.  

Guys, it was so freakin good.  Hope some of you try it :)

Mix three cups flour with three tablespoons of sugar, a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda. 

Grate in 4 tablespoons of cold butter

Gently mix together. 

Add 1/2 cup of raisins, (soaked overnight in scotch or whiskey if desired)

Mix in 1 to 1.5 cups of buttermilk until it can just make a shaggy ball and knead very gently in a floured surface. 

Press into a puck 1.5 to 2 inches thick and place on a floured baking sheet. 

Refrigerate for 15 minutes

Cut into eighths as I did in the picture and brush with 1 tablespoon melted butter. 

Bake 20-25 minutes.

Base   
1/2 Cup Self Raising Flour  
1/2 Cup Plain Flour  
1/2 Cup Cocoa  
3/4 Cup Coconut  
1/2 Cup Brown Sugar  
100g Butter  
3 Tbsp Peanut Butter - crunchy is best

Caramel   
800g (2 cans) Condensed Milk  
75g Butter  
1/2 Cup Golden Syrup

Topping  
2 Cups Roasted Peanuts

Icing  
250g dark chocolate   
1/2 cup of cream 

METHOD  
Base: Mix all dry ingredients together in a bowl. Melt the butter and peanut butter together then combine with the dry ingredients. Press into a greased and lined baking tin. Bake for 10 minutes at 180 C

Caramel: Put all the caramel ingredients in a pot and bring to a simmer. Stir constantly to stop it sticking or burning on the bottom. Cook until the caramel thickens and turns a light brown colour. Pour the caramel over the cooked base and bake again for 10- 15 minutes in the oven. Take out and while the caramel is still hot sprinkle the peanuts on the top evenly.  
Allow to cool before icing.

Icing: Chop the Chocolate into small pieces and melt this with the cream over low heat. Mix until smooth and all chocolate has melted then our over the peanuts.

Refrigerate until the chocolate has set. Cut into slices using a hot knife.

Edit: Of course this gets downvoted right away.

There are three main differences between ragu napoletano and ragu bolognese: 

1. Bolognese uses white wine, Napoletano uses red wine

2. Meat selection varies due to the type of wine.  Meats that don't pair well with white wine aren't normally used in a bolognese and vice versa

3. Bolognese is rather [dry](https://www.nonnabox.com/wp-content/uploads/Ragu_Alla_Bolognese_Recipe-500x375.jpg) due to less tomato being used while Napolatano is [wet](https://img.sodelicious.recipes/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/c9762-25.05.2016-r1-ragu-sausage-pork-and-beef-ragu-300x300.jpg) due to more tomato",1

My only advice if you're interested is to use half the amount of your egg mixture next time, add more of the bacon grease and pasta water and perhaps more parma (you use that right?) to really get the sauce to thicken and emulsify.

Less liquid, and lots more tossing in a bowl should should help with the emulsification and tighten up the sauce.

At least that is how I was taught it should be made when I was cooking professionally in Rome.",1

I don't have an outdoor grill since I'm in an apartment, so I added some liquid smoke, cooked the wings in a covered pan on the stovetop with the sauce added halfway, then finished them on the George Foreman for grill marks. I also used Serrano peppers instead of Habaneros or Scotch Bonnet. I de-seeded them which I wouldn't do if I make it again since it wasn't nearly as spicy as I had hoped. Let me know if you make it!

Ingredients

* 3 chicken leg quarters (patted dry)
* 6 tablespoons butter
* 3/4 yellow onion
* handful of chopped carrots
* half a bag of frozen green beens, or fresh if you've got them
* 3 medium small sized red potatoes chopped
* 3/4 cup chopped mushrooms (cremini worked well)
* spinach (if you have it. It was a fridge emptying expedition so I figured why not)
* handful of fresh flat leaf parsley roughly chopped
* 3 cloves garlic minced 
* Seasonings! I used... Montreal chicken seasoning, garlic salt, celery salt, dried oregano, dried basil, lil bit of red pepper flakes, salt, pepper. 
* 2 cups whole milk
* 3-4 Tablespoons Flour
* 1/2 cup heavy cream

1. Season the chicken with Montreal chicken seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and butter rubbed under the skin and on top. Place in a cast iron pan and baked at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes. I put 1/4 cup chicken stock in the pan to make sure things steamed up and got super tender. I like dark meat chicken, hence the legs - but you do you. 
2. Remove chicken and juices from cast iron pan. Set chicken aside too cool, and keep those juices to throw back in later. 
3. Sauté all of those veggies in that hot cast iron pan(medium heat) with the remaining chicken juices, and let them get cozy together for about 15 minutes until everything is softened. Season these veggies with a generous amount of spices. I used celery salt, oregano, basil, lil bit of red pepper flakes, salt, pepper. 
4. Add about 2 cups of chicken stock (AND those reserved chicken juices) and let simmer for another 15-20 minutes. During this time, shred your chicken. It should have cooled off and officially is out of the burn your fingers stage. I also keep the crispy chicken skin and chop it up to toss in because... chicken skin is bomb.
5. In a large dutch oven, (low-medium heat) melt 5 tablespoons of butter and then add your flour. Whisk that together until its nice and slurrylicious. Add in the milk and cream until its pretty consistent, consistently whisking. It'll thicken up nicely. Salt and pepper this cream. Stir.
6. Add in your veggies and all of the juices, the shredded chicken and skin, and stir all of that goodness together.
7. Donezo.

I had previously homemade the biscuits and frozen them. This was a freezer/fridge clean out recipe, so I don't recall where I got the biscuit recipe. I did however give them a generous amount of butter and salt on the tops before baking them. 

I hope y'all enjoy!",1

You're proud to be an adult, but you failed to learn that scaling in the pictures can be tricky, dishes have different sizes and not all people work wherever you do and not everyone has the same stomach as yours. Which means that your remark was very and very pointless and it really made *you* look stupid. But of course, you can continue defending yourself, it's fine, not that I care much.",1
4341,"No, I wouldn’t say it’s comparable at all. I personally don’t really like any offal because of the bitter, irony, unmistakeably ‘offally’ taste, and I don’t think black pudding tastes remotely offally. The spicing/pepperiness is the overwhelming flavour, with a savoury/umami meatiness behind that. Honestly, if you picture a somewhat spicy sausage meat patty, with a slightly stodgier texture, you’re not far off. If it wasn’t for the dark, slightly intimidating colour, I don’t think most people would bat an eyelid eating it if it was served to them.",1

I like to shred mine right when i turn the oven on, then i throw the bowl of cheese in the freezer and after an hour or so preheat the cheese isnt frozen but its REALLLLY cold helps keep all that fat in there, I mean that's what we're buying the whole fat cheese for, right?!? 

Maybe reddit can make some sort of lobby against the starchy pre shredded cheeses, I dont care if it cakes, I mean who does?  Sounds like they were solving a problem that never existed.",1
4490,Yeah they don’t sell them here,1
4491,Yea it came out pretty good,1
4492,"It's really easy but you need fresh fish for it to be any good IMHO.

Salt and pepper the fish and then put into a container with some yellow corn meal (medium to fine ground). Shake container with lid to coat well. 

Oil should be hot like frying chicken. Depending on how thick the pieces are I normally only fry them for 3-5 mins. The cat fish are so small they aren't filleted so those take a minute or two longer but you will notice when they stop cooking. 

French fries fried like normal but in the south when doing this at scale they are fried in the same pot as the fish so they get coated in the bits of corn meal floating around and that makes them even better. 

Serve with pickles (any kind) or other condiments.

With the mullet I like this hotsauce called tiger sauce which is slightly sweet and spicy.",1

4584,"The small amount of water is simply just to increase the concentration of the pasta starch in the water. It’s another starch emulsifier like flour, it’s just another way of making a roux-like thickening ageng, that is a bit stronger cause of a higher ratio of emulsification agent.

The inherent problem with starch emulsifying, especially in cheese heavy sauces is that the particle size of the particles that are joining the unmixable things are larger, so each clump of mixed stuff is larger. This is very very apparent when it’s in my mouth, and not at all apparent in some people’s mouths. The difference is day and night for me though, and it’s something I can see not only by reflection, but also the way a sauce runs. The method is intelligent, but doesn’t solve the problem I have with common cheese sauces, I respect it a lot and I learned a lot of my cooking knowledge from Kenji.

4788,"I don’t think the color or texture of the dish in the photo immediately discount the idea that this dish was homemade. The recipe OP used from Serious Eats for “3-Ingredient Stovetop Macaroni and Cheese,” which I’ve made before with good result, allows for the use of cheddar or “any other good melting cheese” which can account for the color if they used a white cheddar or other white cheese. The recipe addresses the issue of emulsificationas well...“Cooking in a small volume of water concentrates the starch from the pasta, helping the cheese form a creamy emulsion.” The recipe also calls for the use of evaporated milk which “contains protein micelles, which help keep an emulsified sauce smooth and creamy.” 

I’ve admittedly never used sodium citrate so I can’t personally attest the difference between its use versus the ingredients and method used in the 3 ingredient recipe, but being someone who is always interested in process, I’d be interested to hear your opinion on the the recipe’s use of a smaller amount of water to cook the pasta and the use of evaporated milk to achieve the same effect as the sodium citrate you mentioned.",1

4991,"Yeast has all disappeared from the store shelves here in France. I have been baking bread for me and my family every couple of days and my stock of bread yeast has just run out.

So, although I am still looking at creating a sourdough starter, I decided to try making a super simple yeast free bread to go with tonight's dinner. It is made with four common ingredients and is super simple to make:

500g plain flour  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1 teaspoon salt  
310ml milk

Mix everything until combined and a fairly smooth texture (doesn't take long). Place onto a floured baking tray and flatten down to about 3cm (important). Score deeply with a sharp knife.

Place into a preheated 190°C oven for 35 minutes. It should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.

Don't expect a light fluffy white bread here. This is more like a light scone. I brushed the top with olive oil, sprinkled some flakey salt, garlic powder and dried herbs on top and its damn delicious. My next one will be left plain so we can add some home-made peanut butter or jam as a topping...

3 tablespoons brown sugar

1-1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast

2 quarts water

1/2 cup baking soda

Instructions:
1) In bread machine pan, place the first 4 ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons water or flour if needed).

2) When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough into 8 balls. Roll each into a 20-in. rope; form into pretzel shape.

3) Preheat oven to 425°. In a large saucepan, bring water and baking soda to a boil. Drop pretzels into boiling water, 2 at a time; boil for 10-15 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.

4) Place pretzels on greased baking sheets. Bake until golden brown, 8-10 minutes. Spritz or lightly brush with water. Sprinkle with salt.",1

5471,"The steps are definitely easy to follow, there's just a lot of them and it's a bit messy. Basically: 

Pound out a few chicken breasts, cut them in half, marinate for a while. 

Meanwhile mix up some spices and prep a bowl with flour. Add some of the spice mix to the flour. 

Dunk the marinated chicken into the flour to coat both sides, back in the marinade, back in the flour, rest on a wire rack 15 minutes to let the costing kind of firm up. 

Then fry for about 8-10 minutes at 325. It was my first time frying so kind of tricky to get the temp right, but if you're patient and have a thermometer it's doable. I used a Dutch oven full of canola oil on the stove over medium-high heat. 

After all the pieces are fried, I put them in the oven at 250 to stay warm while I mixed up the final spice /brown sugar/oil mixture to brush on them. 

Absolutely worth it but not something I'd do every day.",1

We eat around 9 am to 11 am here. There are A LOT of different dishes. 
Some examples;
 are Chilaquiles. It's made of triangular fried tortilla, with spicy tomato sauce on top, some add meat or chicken, even eggs on top. 
We have molletes, which is a type of bread (like a baguette but smaller) cut in half and then we smear beans, cheese and chorizo (spicy sausage). They are normally served between 2 and 4.

Quantity is a big factor, but the food here is very heavy if you get what I mean. I feel like British food is a bit light (From my mexican perspective). I was starving everyday because dinner starts at 6 pm there!

You can still get some Smokey flavor on the outside by smoking it at higher temps but it won’t be throughout and you won’t get a crust. For smaller meat like chicken breast you probably made the right choice as the crust might be just too much and make the meat seem dry.,1

2 ml heavy cream

5924,"What’s in that exactly?  I love everything else here, but that kind of turns me off.",1
5925,If my grandma had wheels...,1
5926,I posted a summary of what I used above!,1
5927,It's basically a slightly different version of the English one,1
5928,"In America a burger is a ground meat patty (or something resembling one). 

I understand it's different in other English speaking places.",1
5929,"Fajitas were seasoned with a mixture of cayenne, cumin, onion powder, smoked paprika, pepper, and salt. Pounded the chicken breasts thin and even, seasoned them well, grilled them, rested them, sliced them. 

The thighs were browned in a Dutch oven and then braised in a sauce I made from ancho and chipotle chilis, garlic, tomatoes, and chicken stock. I then shredded the meat in some of the braising liquid. 


2 pounds of fresh tomatillos cut into wedges

2 jalapeños

1 serrano

4 cloves of garlic

1 large white onion, cut into wedges

2 to 3 tsp Kosher salt, depending on taste

Fresh lime juice

I roast the tomatillos, onions, garlic, jalapeños and serrano on an oiled sheet pan at 450F for about 12-15 minutes or until everything starts to brown/blacken nicely. Set aside and let it all cool. Blend thoroughly once it's gotten down to handling temp, adding salt and lime juice as you blend it together. 

For the pico, it's really very simple. I just diced up a pound of really beautiful tomatoes, half a white onion, 1 jalapeño, and a handful of shredded cilantro, and added the juice of one small lime and salt to taste (I did not measure, but I would guess 1/2 tsp to 3/4 tsp) and black pepper. Let it sit 10 minutes, pour off the excess liquid that gets pulled out of the tomatoes, and finish with just a little more fresh lime juice and you're good.

I posted my tortilla instructions in another post, but here they are again:

Recipe is very easy, this made 27 tortillas:

4 cups masa harina

2 tbs lard

3 cups hot water

1 tbs Kosher salt

Add salt to masa. Work the lard into the masa with your fingertips. Gradually mix in the water and knead by hand until a smooth, uniform ball forms. It should feel like sugar cookie dough and NOT be sticky. Let it rest for 30 minutes.

Line a tortilla press with parchment. I like to form the balls for the tortillas all at once so that I can just go assembly line style. Maybe sure they're all approximately the same size. Press them out, and then cook them on a medium-hot skillet or griddle. Around 30 sec for the first side (until it starts to look dry around the edges), then flip it. It should puff a little as it cooks on the flip side. Cook another 30 seconds, then flip back again and finish it out with another 30 seconds.",1
5930,"Well, damn.",1
5931,"Freakin’ love fried mushrooms. Easily my fav part of a fry up. But also, I’m Scottish, so I’d be swapping those hash browns for some tattie scones. And another slice of black pudding, just because.",1
5932,"Wait, but where’s the salad?",1
5933,What a wild ride.,1
5934,Brings me to the idea of trying pineapple/ham with cilantro - tastes nice (at least mentally),1
5935,What’s up what’s up can I come over,1
5936,"Meals like these are why I could never understand why the world likes to say America has such huge portions. I'll give you the restaurants, but they just sell you more food so they can make more money. 

This is homemade though. 3 different proteins, multiple hash browns, huge helping of beans. Thats about on par with American food at the places with the REALLY big plates. Nobody cooks that much for breakfast at home, unless they're trying to impress someone. 

Looks good for sure. Just made me think.",1
5937,This is worthy if r/macncheeseporn,1

5948,"yo, what are the wings to the right?",1
5949,In America a burger has to be a ground meat patty (or something similar to that). This is a solid piece of chicken so it's a sandwich and not a burger. It doesn't matter whether or not it's on a bun.,1

We havent received anything from the baranggay (local govt) ever since the lockdown, well.. actually we got 2 cans of sardines and 3 kilos of rice 4 days ago and it lasted a day for 8 people. (My family and relatives) A lot of ppl in our neighbourhood are experiencing hunger and some of them have babies that need milk and we're not getting any help just bcs we live inside a subdivision. We are law abiding citizens that pay taxes, but they chose give a lot of help to ppl including cash that dont even help the economy, they give help to them but not us. It's very sad.

I hope everybody is doing well. I am asking for help, any amount will go a long way for my family. We have no food to eat in next few days, no work no pay here in the Philippines. Anything will do. Stay safe everyone!

6234,"Beef is the meat that comes from cows.

Bulgogi is a Korean cooking method which involves marinating and then searing very thin slices of beef (usually good quality sirloin or ribeye) or sometimes pork in a marinade comprised chiefly of soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar and garlic, often also gochujang or ginger.

The word ""filled"" indicates that the elements described above this sentence are placed inside the element to be described below this sentence.

Bao are soft Chinese steamed buns made of flour, water, yeast, oil and sugar. They are generally stuffed with a strongly flavored filling which can be sweet (for example red bean paste), or savoury (e.g. bulgogi).

Homemade implies that these were made at the poster's home.

6280,"**Dough Recipe:**

Bread Flour: 16 1/2 oz. (just over 3 cups)

Ice Water: 10.3 oz. (about 1 1/8 cups)

Sugar: 2 tbsp

Kosher or Sea Salt: 1 tsp

Yeast: 1 1/2 tsp

Vegetable or olive Oil: 1 tbs

Dusting flour: For all the dusting, I use half bread flour, half semolina flour. You can use what you want.

**Directions:**

• In mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, yeast.

• While mixing with flat paddle, slowly poor ice water into dry mixture. Your dough will get sloppy. When it does, just give it a couple minutes to recoup and continue with small amounts of water till it's all incorporated.

• Let stand for 10 minutes+ (allows yeast to interact with water)

• Add kosher salt and olive oil. Hand knead until combined.

• Roll into a ball.

• Place in oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 12-24 hours. If 24 hours, first 12 in the fridge.

An hour before preparing the pizza, put dough onto floured surface. Cut into two pieces. Working with one piece, pull the sides up and in until the bottom side resembles a dough ball. Flip over so that the clean looking side is on top and place onto floured cookie sheet. Lightly flour top. Do the same with the other piece, and cover the cookie sheet with plastic wrap. Let rise for about an hour before flattening out and preparing your pizzas.

**If using pizza steel:**

• Place pizza steel on rungs second from the top.

• Preheat oven to highest temperature (550° for mine) with convection/""quick cook"" engaged. Let steel sit for 1 hour in oven after it's preheated.

• 10 minutes before putting pizza in, turn off oven, and turn on the oven broiler (makes steel even hotter.)

• Once pizza is prepared, launch it into the steel with a pizza peel. Let cook for 4 minutes flat, take out and bask in the glory of your better-than-delivery pizza!",1

6629,You should really think about trying Weissman’s bun recipe. I was interested in making a homemade chicken sandwhich months ago and started with the brioche recipe he posted. The bread is 90% of the sandwhich and is so good that I bake them 5 days out of the week because I’m addicted to freshly baked bread now. The biggest problem is that it really is only worth doing if you own a stand mixer and buying one is a heavy investment. I’ve never baked before in my life before I bought mine specifically to make sandwhich buns but I’ve opened up another door in my culinary skills that I really enjoy.,1

I've got a friend who makes almost all her families meals and has done so for several decades. She's not a bad cook either. While she doesn't exactly hate cooking, she definitely doesn't enjoy it. She says she wishes she felt like I do but just can't. As for me, I've made many different outfits for myself and my sons when they were small (and I'm a pretty good seamstress) but I dislike sewing.

I freaked out when the baking time was done and it was liquid on the inside. So the texture probably would've been better had I not added baking time to fix what I thought was an error. 

First time baking a pie. I really liked the oat crust and the inside is super sweet so I liked it. The way it ended up is probably like a creamy peacan pie filling? I wonder if I baked it better how different it would taste.",1

6754,"Approx measurements for my single serving:

- about 3 oz bucatini 
- 4 - 5 bacon strips
- 2 egg yolks and 1 whole egg
- 3 large handfuls of grated pecorino or parmesan (save some for garnish)
- cracked black pepper
- salt

1. Boil water using less than you think for more concentrated starchy water you will use later to create sauce. 
2. Mix the 2 yolks and 1 egg in a bowl until homogenous. Add most of grated cheese and a generous amount of black pepper to eggs. I do about 4 - 5 cranks on my pepper grinder. Should be nice and thick all mixed with the cheese. Set aside. 
3. Cook slices of bacon in a cold pan on medium heat. About 5 - 6 mins. You want crispy edges with some chew on the inside. Chop the bacon and set aside. Leave about 1 - 2 tablespoons of fat in pan. You will put the pasta together in here. 
4. Water should be boiling. Now add lots of salt and your pasta. Cook just below al dente, about 1 minute less than box directions.
5. Using tongs, transfer pasta to pan with fat. Do not drain. It’s okay if pasta water gets in there. Mix vigorously while adding pasta water by the spoonful. Keep mixing over medium heat for a few minutes until water and bacon fat come together.
6. Take pan off heat and slowly add egg mixture, but keep stirring and agitating it to emulsify egg mixture and fat/water. Do this for about a minute or two. Add the bacon somewhere here so it gets heated. Your sauce will be thick and glossy. This isn’t a runny sauce type of dish. The residual heat will make eggs safe to eat.
7. Plate and add grated cheese for garnish as well as a generous amount of black pepper.

Hope that helped. Just don’t crank your heat up too high otherwise it’ll get scrambled. Keep it medium/medium-low and keep on mixing. The dish comes together quickly in the end.",1

6927,"Here’s the foolproof walkthrough of what I did for this dish because... covid &gt;_&lt;

Use a wide pan for this and sauté 1 diced onion in about 2 tbsps oil in low heat until soft, add as many garlic cloves as you like (I typically use around 3-4 cloves), paprika, dried herbs (bay leaf, lots of cumin, some Italian mix - parsley, oregano, etc - whatever you have) and continue to sauté until fragrant.

Add 1 can tomatoes (any way you have - I had used diced because that was the only one I had), I also added in the leftover vegetable scraps from chopping the crudités like carrot tops and the ends of the red bell pepper, liquid from salsa that I ate a few days ago and leftover chickpeas from making the hummus). 

Bring to a slow simmer and season with balsamic vinegar (didn’t have Worcestershire sauce, so I substituted it with this), more dried herbs to your taste, to the consistency you like. If it’s too thick, add liquid - wine, water, stock... if it’s too watery, crank the heat up and boil till the water evaporates. Note that you do want it a bit liquid-y to poach your eggs in. 

Once it’s at the taste and consistency you like, make sure it’s simmering gently on medium heat, make a few wells, crack in however many eggs you like (make sure they are distancing at least an inch apart - hence the wide pan) and cover until the whites are opaque and the yolks are done however you like it (about 5 mins for runny eggs, longer for a solid yolk). 

Enjoy! Let me know if you ever try it :)

Edit: don’t forget to add cumin!",1

6929,"I make eggs Benedict from scratch once a week, it's my favorite brunch food. I can cook it the traditional method without using plastic no problem but I like to learn new cooking techniques.

6931,"Here is the recipe of everyone favorite Baguette

 **Ingredients:**

* 2 kilograms or 70 ounces of bread flour
* 50 grams or 1.8 ounces of sea salt or other non-iodized salt
* 10 grams or 0.35 ounces of instant dry yeast (not active dry yeast)
* 1.2 liters of spring water or 40 ounces at room temperature

**Equipment:**

* [ilFornino Wood fired oven](https://www.ilfornino.com/ilfornino-pizza-ovens/) with a supply of wood 
* Some heavy-duty heat resistant gloves to handle the hot pot
* A large bowl for mixing the dough, or a heavy-duty stand mixer with a dough hook.
* A good digital scale for measuring ingredients
* A large pan to place the dough in for the first rise
* Clean kitchen towels to cover during fermentation of the dough
* A bench scraper
* A sharp knife
* A linen towel or couche as the French call it, and a metal tray for separating the baguettes during final resting before being placed in the oven.
* A peel to place, maneuver and retrieve the bread from the oven.
* 2 Measuring cups and spoon for scraping down the mixing bowl
* A small all-metal pan for introducing steam into the oven for the duration of the baking cycle.

**Preparation** **Method** **of French Bread:**

* Divide the water equally into two cups. (20 ounces each)
* Dissolve the salt in one cup and the yeast into the second cup.
* Empty the yeast and water into the mixing bowl.
* Add all the flour into the mixing bowl and set your mixer on low speed.
* As the flour begins to incorporate, add the remaining water around the edges.
* Scrape the sides of the bowl to get all the flour mixed in.
* Mix for 10 minutes.
* Remove the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until a large smooth ball is created.
* Place the ball with the smooth side up into a large floured pan and using a sharp knife cut a large X into the top of the ball extending about 1/3 down the sides.
* Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 3 hours at room temperature.
* After the first rise, carefully cut the dough ball into 350 gram or 12 and 1/3 ounce pieces.
* Flatten each piece into a small rectangle and roll into a cylinder as you press the heel of your hand as you fold toward you.
* Once closed up, roll the cylinder into approximately 16-inch lengths.
* As you create each baguette, place it on the linen couche that covers a tray. Bunch up the couche/towel so that the loaves do not touch.
* Let the loaves rest covered with a towel for about another hour.
* Fill a small heat resistant pan with water and place it into the oven that is at about 375 degrees.
* After the second rise is complete, and the water is emitting steam in the oven, cut three or four long diagonal slits lightly across the top of each loaf.
* Carefully transfer to a peel and place into your ilFornino oven.
* Close the door and periodically check to see the progress of your loaves.
* It may take 20 minutes. They are done when they are golden brown and offer a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom.
* Remove and allow for cooling on a wire rack.

And here you go with delicious french bread... Try it",1

7065,Thank you! I’m hoping to try some other flavours soon!,1
7066,"As a Cantonese, this makes me miss home so much😭",1
7067,"So the above picture was my first attempt at it! Working on improving!

Bought ingredients as follows:

Dried rice noodles (soaked in warm water for 15mins prior to cooking, drain water after 15mins, save in bowl),

Extra Firm Tofu (let sit wrapped in towel to dry any moisture before frying - roughly 30mins),

Fresh Bean Sprouts

Peanuts (unsalted)

Fresh Carrot / Cabbage Slaw

Green &amp; Red Onion (red onion replacing shallots)

Pre-made Phad Thai sauce (too lazy to make from scratch, next time though!)

As for cooking process:

Start with a tablespoon of oil in hot pan (or wok). Fry off tofu almost to complete liking, and then throw in the red onion (or shallots) and carrot/cabbage slaw; let cook down. Just get a nice stir fry going on. After a couple minutes of that, throw in the noodles and immediately add sauce. I used maybe a 1/4 cup of premade sauce, a touch of water (like 2 tablespoons, just to loosen it up, it was a bit thick), and added chili oil &amp; flakes for spice (depends on your spice preference). Cook that until the sauce is completely gone from the bottom of the pan and absorbed into noodles and meat/tofu. Push all ingredients to side of pan (or wok), add a tablespoon of oil on the side of the pan without the noodles. Cracked 2 eggs straight in, and let them cook for 10-15 seconds; like a sunny side up egg. Once most of the egg white is cooked, begin the scramble and mix everything back together. Throw in some green onion, sprouts and peanuts, and let cook for another 2 minutes or so, stirring and keeping it moving.

Pour straight onto plate. Top with a bit more green onion, sprouts and peanuts on the side. Voila.

One thing I learned was to keep things in the pan moving. Because your pan will be very hot for this dish, letting it sit for too long will quickly cause some ingredients to burn. I only let sit for a tad bit of time between stirs, but continuously keep eye and keep ingredients moving as to not stick and burn.

Hope this helps! Happy to answer any questions you might think of, or I can elaborate on anything more.",1
7068,Call me crazy but I prefer pickled jalapeno to fresh,1
7069,Marshmallows are sticky when made! They need to be dusted in a powder mix so they don’t stick to each other. I was just done doing that - hence the powder all over my hands. No sweat here :),1

7081,Agreed! I made them for the first time last week and they were so good!,1
7082,"Actually it was my first time doing it haha.

I made chicken stock from scratch and had some to use. But you can use any other stock you have, just watch out with the salt content for powders or cartons since some of the stuff you will be adding will be overly salty.

I cooked some mushrooms and pork mince till golden. Added 1/4 sliced onion, the white part of 2 scallions, minced garlic and ginger and cook for a bit. Then I added the stock, 1 tea spoon of gochujang, 3 of gochugaru, 2 of doenjang, 1 cup of kimchi. I also had 1/3 of a hairy melon in the fridge so I cut that in big chunks and threw it in. I cooked for around 10 minutes and added silken tofu. Cook for a bit more and corrected the salt at the end. Topped with the green part of the scallions.

&amp;#x200B;

You can replace the mince with pork belly and also add some fish sauce, soy sauce if you want or other veggies such as daikon or wintermelon. Moreover, if you want it more spicy you can add more gochujang or gochugaru.",1

7084,Replace japs with dill pickle plz,1
7087,"I just cooked down some frozen raspberries mixed with cornstarch, sugar and a little lemon juice. Basically just simmer until it thickens into somewhere between a sauce/jam consistency.

7171,"# Recipe:

*This is a SUPER loose recipe -- can be made from basically anything you have. This is a meat-free version as I didn't have meat or stew bones on hand, but it would make the soup MUCH better and potentially cheaper!*

*Note: It is HIGHLY recommended to wear an apron, wear gloves, and used a not-pretty cutting board when handling beets -- they stain EVERYTHING.*

**Ingredients:**

* 3 med. Yellow Onions, two diced &amp; other left whole
* 6 small Beets, peeled &amp; boiled then grated (add a little vinegar to keep color bright!)
* 4 small Potatoes, cubed into bite-size (or whatever) pieces
* 2 med. Carrots, sliced into thin rounds
* 1 med. Parsnip, sliced into thin rounds
* 2 Celery stalks, one sliced &amp; other left whole
* 3(ish) cups Cabbage, chopped into ribbons
* 4 cups Stock, veggie or meat (water works if you don't have stock!)
* 2 cups Water
* 4 cloves Garlic, two minced/grated &amp; two thinly sliced
* Spices: salt, pepper, bay leaf, garlic powder, dill, celery greens
* Sour Cream or Russian Mayo to preference

**Method:**

* Prep EVERYTHING beforehand -- it'll make life easier
* Bring water &amp; stock to boil; add WHOLE beets, whole onion, and whole celery stalk
* Boil from 10-20 minutes; test tenderness of beets w/ fork; discard (or don't) other veggies
   * *OPTIONAL*: strain broth to keep it clear -- I didn't though
* Boil turnip, cabbage, potato, sliced garlic until potato/cabbage is tender
* Fry/sautee carrots, onions, celery, minced garlic until tender; add to soup
   * More Ukrainian flavor -- skip this step for a more Russian taste!
* Throw spices into the soup to taste preference
   * *OPTIONAL*: add a healthy portion of **homemade** Kvas (not that syrupy store-bought stuff) and/or white vinegar for a little extra sourness
* Boil everything together for a minute or two; **turn off the heat**
* Add grated beets and **let sit covered** for 10-20 minutes
   * This cooks the beets while also allowing the soup to take color
* Serve hot or color (preferable) w/ healthy topping of sour cream or Russian mayo &amp; dill

There's a saying that goes *""for today's borsch, come tomorrow,""* meaning that borsch is best served after being able to sit for a day or two! This picture doesn't do the bright red color justice -- after a day in the fridge EVERYTHING took on the color! This recipe makes about a gallon of soup, so freeze some (or don't) for later! Enjoy!

*EDIT: parsnip not turnip, debil...*",1

7483,"I’ve done it that way, but for me it’s slow cooker for 5 hours in high, then I pull the meat and crisp it in a cast iron skillet- a little of the fat from the top of the juice, first, brown one side, turn with tongs, a little more fat, and some juice from the slow cooker. You can also broil it but I find the skillet satisfying and much easier to control. Mine scorched a bit in the dutch oven too, and you hate to get all that way and have something bad happen. Also, these freeze really well- I put some meat in a quart size freezer bag, juice in a sandwich bag, a little of the fat in another bag, and freeze together in yet another gallon freezer bag.",1

For the filling I boiled a bunch of russet potatoes then peeeled the skins, mashed them up added some sauteed yellow diced onions and grated a lot of cheese in there. 
Cookie cut circles into your rolled out dough (I used a wine glass lol) and then filled it with some of the potato filling and pinched it together! Once done boil for a bit and then pan fry in oil and butter for #health

&gt;Exactly how many people does this person expect to feed

Probably two?  I use a full 16oz box to make dinner for two adults and two kids and it works out so the recipe seems about right to me.

To put a number on it, 8oz of pasta is about 800 calories before you even put anything on it.  Then adding a good amount of a creamy/cheesy sauce and meat is going to roughly double that number.  Seems about right for serving two people that eat three meals a day.",1

From there it was a battle to get a stable 350° oil to fry in, I used a thermometer to make sure it was consistent. Then I battered and fried some shrimp that I had deveined and detailed so that eaters could pop the whole thing in their mouths. Finally, it was a 50/50 Cholula to melted butter ratio for the sauce, which I tossed the semi cooled fried shrimp in and dropped onto a wire rack to strain. Easy as that!",1

7614,"Hey there, so my tomatillo salsa recipe is as follows (this is using the oven, normally I'd use my grill but that wasn't an option this week):

2 pounds of fresh tomatillos cut into wedges

2 jalapeños

1 serrano

4 cloves of garlic

1 large white onion, cut into wedges

2 to 3 tsp Kosher salt, depending on taste

Fresh lime juice

I roast the tomatillos, onions, garlic, jalapeños and serrano on an oiled sheet pan at 450F for about 12-15 minutes or until everything starts to brown/blacken nicely. Set aside and let it all cool. Blend thoroughly once it's gotten down to handling temp, adding salt and lime juice as you blend it together. 

For the pico, it's really very simple. I just diced up a pound of really beautiful tomatoes, half a white onion, 1 jalapeño, and a handful of shredded cilantro, and added the juice of one small lime and salt to taste (I did not measure, but I would guess 1/2 tsp to 3/4 tsp) and black pepper. Let it sit 10 minutes, pour off the excess liquid that gets pulled out of the tomatoes, and finish with just a little more fresh lime juice and you're good.",1

600g APF

Let sit for 20 min.

Knead for 5min. and form into a tight round ball when done. 

Lightly oil a bowl and the dough ball and place it in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap for 3-4h or until double in size.

Dump onto lightly oiled counter top, de-gas and divide in 2 tight balls.

Place each round onto a lightly oiled plate or tray and loosley cover with plastic wrap.

Dough will hold at room temperature for 2-4 hours until ready to bake.

Heavily flour a work surface, form a 1"" rim with your finger tips and stretch the dough to approx 15"".

Spread tomato sauce and low moisture mozerella on the pizza.

Bake on a pizza steel for approx 7min that was pre-heated to 550°F for 1 hour. Broil the pizza steel for 5min before loading the pie and broil for the last minute as well.  The pizza steel should be less than 8"" from the top of your oven.

For the sauce use a can of San Marzano Tomatoes (around 700g) Saute a small onion in olive oil, blend the tomatoes and add to the onions.  Add 5g of sea salt, some oregano and basil and simmer for 1h.  Allow to cool on the stovetop before using.",1

7769,"Amazing! need to get my basil growing! Been eating a lot of za in quarantine, time and dough is on my hands",1
7770,"On top is about 4oz of mozzarella, 4 slices meunster, 2 slices provolone. 

Hand-grated mozzarella melts better. The stuff in the bags has cellulose to help prevent the cheese from sticking....but it does funny stuff in the oven. 

I avoid off-brand cheeses. I didn't have good provolone, so Primadella was the winner tonight.",1
7771,Ha! Whatever happened to Tom?,1
7772,"I looove black pepper! I put it on most of my savory meals. My husband always says I overdo the pepper but hey, I like it. It did bring out the flavor, which I didn’t know about so it was a pleasant surprise.",1

7778,This looks like the one meme with the 5 huge black guys standing behind that tiny white pornstar lol,1
7779,That's sounds banging. I'm also assuming you did the pepper on the strawberry to make the flavour stronger,1
7780,Lol ohhh it’s ok ... I may make your recipe for my husband. We LOVE cheese,1
7781,"Those look delicious! And quite beautiful. Also, is your nick a reference to the movie?",1

And cream cheese glaze goes on nearly everything.",1
7814,Why strawberry?,1
7815,"Lovely! Looks so light, and delicious!",1
7816,"Meat filling is a 2:1 ground beef to sweet sausage with secret spice blend and a binder.

After browning the meat, [DRAIN IT WELL] I mix in my own sauce, mozzarella, meunster, and provolone cheese to make it sticky. 

Always use Barilla brand jumbo shells. Par boiled 8-9 minutes (they finish cooking while baking)

Place a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a 13x9 baking dish. Helps prevent burning/sticking.

Over stuff the shells. Place pasta side down (filling up) in pan. Easiest to do a single layer, but can be doubled if a layer of cheese is placed in between. 

Top shells with some additional sauce. Then sprinkle as much mozzarella as you like. I also placed sliced meunster and sliced provolone in a spiral pattern. 

What's great about the recipe is mine will be different every time simply by changing cheeses, spice blend, or even the meat ratio.  My sauce is made from scratch, but jar sauce will work in this recipe as well.",1
7817,What a great twist on an old classic!,1
7818,"Better yet, fry up an egg, and slap that ish between two slabs of bread with some ketchup.",1

7850,"The recipe I posted for this bread is super easy, the author made it very accessible. Her blog in general has great tips and recipes, she explains things well. As for banana bread, my main tip in addition to those in her recipe is to use coarse sugar instead of the icing, which turns somewhat slimy. 
Also, when greasing my loaf pan, I add powdered sugar in there and tap it around lot to fully coat the bottom and sides with the sugar. It helps it to get a sweet little crust and come out of the pan more easily. I also add a thin layer of mixed cinnamon-sugar on top (in addition to the coarse sugar) before putting it in the oven so the top becomes more crispy. I hope that’s helpful and I apologize for the format, I’m on mobile.

7860,Thank you so much for this! Would you have an estimate on how much potato starch you use after you add the egg? Mine tasted delicious but wasn't very crunchy and I think it's because I used the incorrect amount of starch,1
7861,"Thank you! It's a sour cream topping, pretty simple, sour cream, sugar, and vanilla. Basically you cook the cheesecake until it's done and then let it cool for 15 minutes. Spread the sour cream mixture on top then put it back in the over for 10 minutes or so.",1

7920,"Toppings are leftover honey ham (needed an out to use some of it), parboiled carrots, shiitake mushrooms and scallions.

The ""ramen"" itself is spaghetti that had been boiled in ~1tbsp baking soda and some salt to give it a slightly more ramen-texture since I was out and the stores didn't have any.

Broth was homemade, using stock made from a leftover honey-ham bone and veggie scraps that were boiled for ~2 hours, then mixed with sesame oil, soy sauce and used to parboil/cook the vegetables to lend their flavors as well.

Overall, the broth/soup was the best part, but it was good and satisfying overall.",1
7921,"But they are sunny side up, the alternative would be easy over. Both are fried eggs.",1

7988,"Just had a craving for apple pie. Quarntine is boring, but, you can cook awesome stuff!!! This is a simple apple pie recipe for y'all :) 

Crust and lattice and designs: (for a ten inch pie, which is about 25 centimetres)

750 grams plain flour

125 grams sugar

1 teaspoon salt

615 grams butter COLD!!!!!

3/4 cups ICED!!!!!!! water (you might not use it all.)

filling:

some extra lemons and water

1.5kg apples, I use fuji (try pick big apples, so less core, more flesh

3/4cups sugar

1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice

zest of 1/2 lemon

65 grams butter

3/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 tablespoon corn starch

optional: pinch of nutmeg

toppings:

1 egg

1 tablespoon heavy cream / milk

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

1/4 cup sugar

method:

1. Start by combining all dry ingredients for dough in a food processor / mixer with dough hook. Now, add in COLD butter and mix. Slowly add water. So not add in all at once. after 1.4 of water is poured in, check your batter. It shouldn't be ready yet. Ready batter means crumbs, but when you squeeze with your hand it will clump into a dough. If that is your case, great. Otherwise, keep adding water until it is like that. chill the dough for at least an hour
2. For the filling, core and slice apples into small pieces, and put readily sliced apples into some water with lemon slices in it. This will prevent them from browning while you slice the other apples.
3. After you did that, pour all the water out, keeping the apples in, and pour lemon juice. Toss. Now add sugar. Toss. Prepare a large pan. Melt butter. Pour all the apples in and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Now add cinnamon and zest. Stir. Now, cook for 5 mins, lid on stirring twice during that time. Now, add cornstarch and nutmeg. Cook for a further 3 mins stirring once. Put a sift on a bowl. Pour apples through sift so the liquids go through. Put the sift with the apples on a plate to catch any more liquid. Put the liquid pack on the pan. Now, cook for a while, stirring the whole time. Slowly, it should thicken and take a while to cover its tracks when you mix it. Pour the liquid in the apple mixture. Mix until combined. Bring tho room temperature, in the fridge, or if you have time, just on the counter.
4. Now, make the pie. It's sort of hard to describe how to do this in words, so I will try. Sprinkle surface with flour. Place dough out, and let rest for a while and sprinkle with dough again on top. Roll it out, so it is a nice round shape. Once it is thin enough, place on top of a pie pan. Slowly push the pastry into the pan\\. Cut off any excess. pour apple filling in. Make a lattice with some more dough. You can make any decorations you want.
5. Make an egg wash with cream and egg. Mix. Make sure to brush entire surface. Now, mix sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle generously across the pie. Create a ""tent"" out of folded aluminium foil to cover the edges of the pie. You can also use store-bought ones.
6. Bake at 205 degrees celsius for 30 mins, then lower temperature to 190 and cook for 15 mins. Take the tent off. Check the colour. If it could use a little more time in the oven, cook for 5 further minutes. Take out, cook, and slice. Serve with cream, ice cream and berries. ENOY!!!!

8019,"Fried eggs*  not sunny side up. Sorry, I keep mixing them up since we call them something different in my native language.",1
8020,"It's so easy and one of my best time-taste value foods :) 

1 1/2 Chicken breasts 
3 Tablespoons Soy Sauce 
1 Tablespoon Honey (I think it's more than enough, though some recipies ask for 2) 
Orange juice (about 1/3 of a ripe orange) 
1 Tbs of sesame Oil (don't overdo it, sesame is really potent) 
a bit of grated ginger (think about 1/2 teaspoon to a tsp) 

Marinate it for at least 30 minutes then in a pan on medium high until you get the glaze or for however long you want your chicken to cook, I cut mine pretty thin so it's more like 2 and a half minutes on each side so you get 4 to 5 minutes cook time 

After, set the chicken aside, throw some butter in to taste, I would say about 1 tbs but it's only preference. 

Throw in that rest of the marinade into the pan, reduce it until it's how sticky you want it, then throw in the chicken and cover it evenly with the sauce. 

Garnish with roasted sesame seeds and green onion. 

Don't set the temperature to high since you can easily burn the sauce and it tastes really really bitter afterwards, so maybe even go to medium and leave it at that, although you will then get a saucy sauce and not that famous glaze. It tastes great either way :) 

I hope it helped!

8193,"Hey sorry! It's not a super complex or intense recipe, but it is time consuming. 

-6 onions (I used 2 sweet, 2 red, and 2 white)  
-1 stick butter  
-6 cloves garlic  
-8oz Red wine (I used Malbec. Mmmmmm, Malbec...)  
-4 cups Beef broth  
-6oz shredded gruyere  
-Crusty bread  


Slice the onions thin. Smash the garlic.  
  
In a large pan (I ended up using 2 pans), melt butter on med-high heat and drop in sliced onion. Saute/stir onion to coat until onions become translucent. (If you used two pans, you can combine them back into one now)  
  
Reduce heat to low and let the onion continue to cook for an hour or two, stirring/scraping the pan every 5-7 minutes. Your onions will start to look almost like a jelly.  
  
Pour in wine and reduce until most of the liquid is gone. Add Beef Broth and simmer 10-15 minutes.  

  
Ladle some soup into bowls, place slices of bread on top, and coat with gruyere. Broil until the cheese is a nice golden color like you see in the picture. 

Enjoy your food coma!

8259,"Not quite.

It's actually ""spilt"".  No dramas, it happens to the best of us.

Best thing to do in the first instance is get a little air into your yolks by whisking them vigorously then add a very small ammount of clarified butter at a time while whisking your yolks in your bowl of slightly bowling water.  Only when you see thick ribbons forming can you start to incorporate the clarified butter in larger amounts.

If a sauce does split on you, you can still save it.  Option 1 is to whisk a teaspoon of boiling water at a time until your sauce thickens again.  Option 2 is to get another yolk into a fresh bowl, again whisk some air into it over your water on the heat, then very slowly add your split sauce until you get those all important ribbons, then you can incorporate your split sauce more quickly.

Great job OP on all the other elements of the dish!",1

Cook one box spaghetti in heavily salted water (before you add the pasta taste the water... it should taste good!).
While it’s cooking finely grate about 1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese (or pecorino, or a combo of Parm and Asiago like I did).
In a large skillet melt 1/4 cup butter and a couple Tbsp olive oil. Stir in about 2 tsp freshly ground pepper. 
When the pasta is al dente scoop about a cup of water out of the pot and reserve and then scoop all the pasta into your skillet (I just used tongs). Quickly toss the pasta with the butter and pepper. Add in all the cheese and most of the pasta water. Stir until it’s saucy. Add more water if needed.

8328,"gredients: 10-12 Organic Lemons (the alcohol will pull out anything on, or in the peels)

1 fifth (750 ML) of Grain Alcohol (You can use high proof vodka but it won’t taste exactly the same.)

half gallon of water

1.5 pounds of white sugar

Step One Wash and peel lemons. Make sure you only peel the skin without getting the white part (pith) of the lemon.

Place the lemon shavings in a big jar and add grain (pure) alcohol. Seal the jar and let it infuse for 3 weeks. (The lemons need to soak in the alcohol this long to pull all of the color and flavor out of the skins.)

Step Two

Bring water to a boil and add white sugar. Stir and turn off.

When the water completely cools add the now yellow alcohol to the water using a strainer so the lemon skins don’t go into the limoncello.

Add a small glass of water into the lemon peel jar, mix it around to get any of the other alcohol and lemon flavor out and add it back to the main lemoncello mix.

Last mix the limoncello really well for a couple of minutes and put it into the freezer.",1

8454,"First attempt at biscuits so I followed the Bon Appetit ‘best biscuit’ instructions. I don’t have a food processor so I just used a potato masher to cut the butter into the dry ingredients.


Ingredients:

2½ teaspoons baking powder

2 teaspoons kosher salt

2 teaspoons sugar

¼ teaspoon baking soda

3½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface

1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch 
pieces, plus more, melted, for brushing

1 cup chilled buttermilk


Instructions:


Preheat oven to 425°. Pulse baking powder, salt, sugar, baking soda, and 3½ cups flour in a food processor to combine. Add chilled butter and pulse until largest pieces of butter are the size of a pea. Transfer to a large bowl and gradually drizzle buttermilk over top, tossing with a fork as you go to incorporate. Knead mixture a few times in bowl until a shaggy dough forms (mixture will look a little dry), then turn out onto a clean surface and pat into a 1""-thick square.

Using a knife or bench scraper, cut dough into 4 pieces. Stack pieces on top of one another, sandwiching any loose dry bits of dough between layers, and press down to flatten. Lift up dough with bench scraper and dust surface with flour. Roll dough into a 1""-thick rectangle and trim a thin border around sides of dough to create clean edges. Cut into a 4x3 grid to make 12 biscuits (don’t reroll scraps). Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 2"" apart; freeze 10 minutes.

Brush tops of biscuits with melted butter and place in oven. Reduce oven temperature to 400° and bake biscuits until deep golden brown on bottom and golden on top, 20–25 minutes",1

Get the pan piping hot and drop a dab of butter in there. Then, put the ball of beef in, lay some baking paper over then top then use a wide spatula (or similar) to squeeze it flat and hold it flat for about 30 seconds.

8505," Ingredients:

* 10-12 Organic Lemons (the alcohol will pull out anything on, or in the peels)
* 1 fifth (750 ML) of Grain Alcohol (You can use high proof vodka but it won’t taste exactly the same.)
* half gallon of water
* 1.5 pounds of white sugar

Step One

1. Wash and peel lemons. Make sure you only peel the skin without getting the white part (pith) of the lemon.
2. Place the lemon shavings in a big jar and add grain (pure) alcohol. Seal the jar and let it infuse for 3 weeks. (The lemons need to soak in the alcohol this long to pull all of the color and flavor out of the skins.)

**Step Two**

1. Bring water to a boil and add white sugar. Stir and turn off.
2. When the water completely cools add the now yellow alcohol to the water using a strainer so the lemon skins don’t go into the limoncello.
3. Add a small glass of water into the lemon peel jar, mix it around to get any of the other alcohol and lemon flavor out and add it back to the main limoncello mix.
4. Last mix the limoncello really well for a couple of minutes and put it into the freezer.

**Serve ice cold in a small shot style glass.**

Prep Time: 45 minutes

Cook Time: 19 minutes

Additional Time: 26 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

Servings: 12 cupcakes

Moist lemon cupcakes topped with bright, beautiful blueberry frosting. If you're looking for the prettiest cupcakes around - these lemon blueberry cupcakes are just the thing.

Ingredients

Lemon Cupcakes

1/2 cup unsalted butter

1 cup granulated sugar

2 tbsp lemon zest use 1 tbsp for less strong lemon flavor

3 egg whites large

1 tsp vanilla extract

1 1/2 cups cake flour not self rising*

2 tsp baking powder

1/4 tsp salt

3 tbsp lemon juice fresh

1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt I recommend using full fat

Blueberry Frosting

1 1/3 cups blueberries fresh or frozen

3/4 cup unsalted butter soft

3 - 3.5 cups powdered sugar

1 tablespoon whipping cream as needed

Instructions

Lemon Cupcakes

Preheat the oven to 350F degrees and line a muffin pan with muffin papers.

In a large bowl beat together the butter, sugar and lemon zest until fluffy.

Beat in the egg whites and vanilla extract.

In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.

Carefully beat in about 1/2 of the flour mixture into the butter mixture, followed by about 1/2 of the yogurt. Repeat with the rest of the flour mixture and yogurt.

Stir in the lemon juice.

Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin pan, filling each about 2/3 to 3/4 full.

Bake for 16-19 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.

Blueberry Frosting

Add the blueberries to a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.

Gently stir as the blueberries start to soften. The mixture will start to gently boil and form a thick sauce. (About 10-15 minutes at a gentle boil).

Remove from the heat and push the blueberry sauce through a strainer to remove any large chunks.

Place in the fridge to cool fully.

In a a large bowl beat the butter until soft. Then beat in 2 cups of the powdered sugar.

Beat in 2-3 tablespoons of the reduced blueberry mixture (it needs to be fully cold first).

Then beat in the rest of the powdered sugar about 1/2 cup at a time, followed by 1 tablespoon of cream if needed until the desired sweetness is reached.

Frost the cooled cupcakes using a piping bag and tip (I used a 1M tip) or a knife.

Notes

*If you don't have cake flour, sift together 1 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour with 1/4 cup cornstarch as a substitute. **Store cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Unfrosted cupcakes can be frozen and then thawed in the fridge overnight.",1

8623,"This is one of the simplest chicken curries I know. Only 7 spices (4 powdered, 3 whole), onions, chickens, chilies and greek yogurt!

Let's get started with the marinade.

- 0.5 kg chicken
- 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp red chill powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup Greek yogurt

Mix it all together, let the chicken sit in the fridge (covered, of course, with something like cling film), for up to 5.5 hours, then 0.5 hours outside the fridge for it to come back up to room temp.

I should look something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/LmiMpCq.jpg).

Next, we get straight to cooking and the only extra things you'll need are onions and chilies and some whole spices and a repeat of some earlier powdered spices.

- 3 - 4 big onions - sliced
- 3 small chilies, mix of green and red - chopped
- 6 cloves
- 4 pods of green cardamom
- 1 inch cinnamon
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp red chili powder
- 2 tbsp oil

Some pictures of the [onions](https://i.imgur.com/usXjmic.jpg) and [chilies](https://i.imgur.com/uKJ2C2g.jpg).

Heat oil in a pot, you can use coconut oil, canola oil, anything really, but mustard oil works best. Once lightly smoking set heat to medium. Throw in the cardamom, cumin and cinnamon and let it fry for a minute. Like [this](https://i.imgur.com/sKKEEy0.jpg).

Add the [onion and chilies](https://i.imgur.com/DygAA8o.jpg) and cook till onions have [softened and browning](https://i.imgur.com/CGLHdZL.jpg).

Add the coriander, turmeric and red chili powders, mix well and cook till the raw smell goes away (if you can't tell when the raw smell has gone, just make sure you cook for at least half a minute). [Add the chicken](https://i.imgur.com/VYPWl2e.jpg), you want to mix well, coat everything and cook till the chicken has gone from pink to [white on the outside](https://i.imgur.com/YopEp1z.jpg). Once you get there, [add 2 cups of water](https://i.imgur.com/tSbQWBU.jpg), cover and cook for 20 minutes on medium heat.

After 20 minutes check if the chicken is cooked. If not and the gravy seems too dry, add some more water and check every 5 minutes till chicken is cooked. Adjust for salt along the way.

Add some fresh coriander and you're done! Recommended with basmati rice.

Now some tips on how to think about this recipe:

- How much red chili powder to add is a personal preference and you'll want to adjust till you get it right. Maybe start with half the quantities mentioned and then work your way up.
- How much water to add depends on how much gravy you want at the end. Some people like it thick, some enjoy a watery curry. You want to make sure that in the end you have both perfectly cooked chicken and the desired thickness of gravy.
- The fresh coriander at the end is optional but it adds an extra dimension to the flavor.
- Garam masala, for me, has always been something to add to almost everything. Even with this dish, I add some extra at the end right before taking it off the flame. This is based on personal preference.

As always, don't forget to have fun, experiment and enjoy the journey as much as the destination. I've peppered image links to give an idea of how each step should look like.",1

8649,"**FOR SOUP:**

6 oz Chicken (or any meat you prefer, or no meat works too)

13.5 oz Chicken bone broth (Preferred, but any broth will work)

1 can coconut milk (13.5 oz)

3.5 tbsp sugar

½ cup cilantro (about half a bundle~)

1 diced red chili pepper if you want it spicy

4 lemon or lime leafs

1 stalk lemongrass (paste works too, about ½ tbsp)

~2 tbsp fish sauce (up to ⅓ cup if you like it, but I don’t)

3-5 slices ginger (¼ tbsp paste or some dashes of powdered works too)

Broccoli, mushroom, peppers, asparagus or whatever veggies you want. Chopped or diced.


**FOR BOWL:**

⅓ cup lemon or lime juice

1-2 tbsp chili oil

1 chopped green onion

**DIRECTIONS:**

*I like doing a veggie version, I replace the meat steps with the veggies*

*I also like dicing all the veggies into small cubes, but that’s just preference*


* Prepare the veggies, and meat if using meat
For the lime leafs; cut in half longways along the stem
* In a pot on medium-low heat; add the broth and let it get to a simmer. Once broth is simmering for a few minutes, add the lemongrass, lime leaf, red chili pepper and ginger. Don’t stir. (If you’re using lemongrass paste instead, then put that in the broth first and stir it around a bit).
* Simmer for 6 minutes, then add the stem portion of cilantro. Don’t stir.
* Once boiling turn the heat to low; add the chicken. Let the chicken turn white, then add the fish sauce and sugar. Stir to mix everything together.
* Turn heat back to medium low; Boil for 6 minutes, or until chicken is cooked.
* Add the veggies, and let them get a little soft.
* Add the coconut milk, still at medium-low heat, and stir in to mix all together. 
* While waiting for that to get to a boil, prepare the bowl.
Grab a medium sized bowl. Pour lemon/lime juice, chili oil, and green onion into the bowl. Stir a little and roll around to cover the walls and base of the bowl.
* Once soup is done, ladle the soup gently into the bowl. Stir just a LITTLE. And garnish with cilantro and green onion.",1

First time for me being without a microwave.  Don't realize how much you would use a microwave until you no longer had one.  If you toss in a little bit of water into the scrambled eggs when you heat it up, it actually will remain a little moist.  Use to do that a lot when I was in a rush to get to work.",1

8814,"It is a bit involved if you are making from scratch, there are recipes on older posts here but if you want to start with an easy way then the jar sauces are pretty good but not as good as homemade of course. 

If you buy a jar sauce look for Indian ones and those that use real cream. 

To cook it do the following:

1. Cut up your chicken into cubes or shapes you like.

2. Take a couple tablespoons of the jar sauce and mix it with the chicken and allow it to marinate for 30 minutes in the fridge. 

3. Spread the chicken on a foil lined baking sheet and bake it in the oven til cooked through, you can broil it for a bit if you want some colour but be careful to monitor it. 

4. Put the cooked chicken in a pot or frying pan with the rest of the sauce and simmer on low heat for 10 minutes or so stirring now and again. If the sauce is too thick for you you can dilute it by adding a bit of milk. 

Serve that over basmati rice and with some naan and you are set. Naan can be found in most stores and a little time in the toaster will warm it through and make it softer.",1

I started by cutting chicken fillets into chunks and left to marinade in a mixture of rice wine vinegar and soy sauce, even quantities of each. Cut potatoes and boil for maybe 10 mins, empty water out, leave to sit while getting the spice mix ready, I used salt, pepper, cumin, chilli powder, Chinese 5 spice and garlic from the pantry. I gradually added this over the chips while I shook the pan to bash the chips a bit before transferring to a baking tray and drizzling a little oil over the top. They were then put in the oven @ 200°. I then chopped the veg, I used 1x red pepper, 1x orange pepper, 2x red chillies, 1x white onion and 1x red onion. I added these to the baking tray with the chips once I felt the chips were starting to colour. For the chicken I dipped each piece in plain flour before deep frying in a pan for 5 mins before draining on kitchen towel. Once the chips looked almost done, I added the chicken to that tray, along with 4× chopped spring onions and back into the oven for 10 mins.",1

• 1/2 Gallon Whole Milk  
• 1 pint Heavy Cream  
• 1 tsp. fine sea salt  
• 3 tsp. fresh lemon juice (or sub white vinegar)

Yields 2 cups delicious and creamy Ricotta!

**Instructions:**  
Add milk, cream, &amp; salt to (at least) 6 qt. heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to rolling boil, stirring occassionally. Once mixture has reached boil, add your acid, and stir to combine. Reduce heat to simmer for 2 minutes WITHOUT STIRRING to allow curds to form. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.

Pour mixture into a cheesecloth lined strainer contained within a large bowl/pot to catch the whey. Allow to drain for 30-40 minutes. Add salt to taste if needed, discard whey-or get creative using it for something else. Refrigerate up to 4 days.

9037,"Sure! 


I simply used penne for the pasta. As that boiled in another skillet I got broccoli, cut to whatever size you are comfortable with, grilled chicken breasts, you can either go the route of homemade or store bought. I didn’t use any spices for the chicken, just plain and again cut to a comfortable size, finally a four cheese Alfredo sauce 2 pre made in a jar, all in a skillet and let it cook at medium heat as the water boils, stirring as needed. When the penne was done, strain and immediately add to the sauce. Cook the mix for another 5 minutes on medium heat again stirring. Drop the temperature all the way down to low and let it simmer for two minutes to slightly thickened up. Cut the heat and serve immediately.",1
9038,"I use the clear plastic wrap we get for usage in fridges (you know, to avoid having the smell of other foods to contaminate your dish). I then coated it with a light touch of spray-on cooking oil (So the poached egg does not stick to the saran-wrap.

9046,Serious question - how’s the spinach? Seems like it would be mushy cooked in a pressure cooker.,1

9073,"**For the chicken marinade:**

28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs (cut into bite-sized pieces)

1 cup plain yogurt

1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic

1 tablespoon ginger

2 teaspoons garam masala

1 teaspoon turmeric

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili ((or 1/2 teaspoon ground red chili powder))

1 teaspoon of salt

-
**For the sauce:**

2 tablespoons of vegetable/canola oil

2 tablespoons butter

2 small onions ((or 1 large onion) finely diced)

1 1/2 tablespoons garlic (finely grated)
1 tablespoon ginger (finely grated)

1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander

14 oz (400g) tomato puree ((tomato sauce/Passata))
1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili ((optional for colour and flavour))
1 teaspoon ground red chili powder ((adjust to your taste preference))
1 teaspoon salt

1 1/4 cups of heavy or thickened cream ((use evaporated milk for lower calories))
1 teaspoon brown sugar

1/4 cup water (if needed)

4 tablespoons Fresh cilantro or coriander (to garnish)

-
In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).

Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)

Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. 

Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala, cumin, turmeric and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.

Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.

Stir the cream through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water to thin out the sauce, if needed.

Garnish with cilantro (coriander) and serve with fresh, hot basmati rice.

I blend the sauce before adding the cream 🙂

9074,Where else would you put it on the plate?,1
9075,You only need a tiny amount of vinegar for this. The lowered pH of the cooking medium allows the egg whites to coagulate at a lower temperature. The high acidity of vinegar means you can lower the pH of water significantly at a low ratio. Even a tablespoon per 2 cups will help the egg whites coagulate.,1
9076,So I made these a few days ago. At 2 immediately. Ate another after dinner. Then woke up at 530am the next morning and at the last one with milk. Not my proudest moment lol,1

9180,"**Ingredients**

* 3 slices bacon
* 2 cups diced onions
* 2 cups chopped mushrooms
* 1 lb Italian sausage (hot or mild)
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 3/4 cup chicken broth
* 1/2 cup cream (regular or heavy)
* 1 (14.5 oz) can petite diced tomatoes
* 9 oz tortellini (fresh or frozen)
* 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes
* 2 cups fresh baby spinach

**Instructions**

1. Chop the bacon and cook in a large skillet or dutch oven. Remove the bacon, but leave the grease in the pot.
2. Begin sauteing the onions and mushrooms in the residual grease.
3. After a few minutes, add the sausage. The source recipe goes to great lengths to explain how to remove it from the casing, but just do whatever works. I find squeezing from the end the easiest. 
4. Break the sausage into small pieces (roughly thumb-sized) and allow to brown at medium-high heat. 
5. Once the sausage is browned, reduce the heat to low, add the garlic, and stir until fragrant (around 30 seconds).
6. Add the broth, cream, diced tomatoes, tortellini, and sun-dried tomatoes to the pot. Stir to combine and increase the heat to bring to a boil. The sun-dried tomatoes can go in whole or chopped. I accidentally put them in whole, but they mostly fell apart.
7. Cover, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
8. After simmering, add salt and pepper to taste. Then add the spinach, stirring until soft and wilted.
9. Remove from heat and serve.

Full truth, I didn't create this recipe, but I did modify [this](https://www.kevinandamanda.com/italian-sausage-tortellini/) recipe from [kevinandamanda.com](https://kevinandamanda.com). I nearly missed half of the steps and let some of the onions burn to the pot, but it still turned out delicious.",1
9181,"Was this https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1039628/Cherry-almond-loaf.html but I changed it up and bit, used different cherries and put almonds on top and I didn’t have as much ground almond so I put less milk

Also I did do it at 150° bc fan oven and it took 65mins but normally with this over it takes less time to cook like if I have a recipe that’s 45 mins I do for 38

It’s not the greatest recipe but good luck!!",1

9369,"Here it is. Sorry for any formatting errors. I originally sent this to friends who don't cook so it's probably a little over explained

Prep
Oven to 350f

--------------
MAKE DRY MIX

4 1/2 Cups All Purpose Flour
2 Teaspoons Baking Soda
Pinch of salt

--------------
MAKE WET MIX

2 Cups Soft Butter
1 1/2 C Brown Sugar  
BEAT THIS DELICIOUS MESS TILL FLUFFY(ISH)

1/2 Cup White Sugar
2x 3.4oz Vanilla Pudding  
ADD THAT IN AND MIX SOME MORE

4 Room Temp Eggs
2 Teaspoons Vanilla   
BEAT INTO WET MIX A LITTLE AT A TIME

--------------
COMBINE WET AND DRY MIX

Slowly stir in Dry Mix by hand about 1Cup at a time. Don't over-mix because it will make the cookies too dense.

4 Cups Choc... like 3 or 4 big bars. I just freeze them and smash in a ziplock and add to the mix. Be careful not to over-mix the flour
----------------
REFRIGERATE

At this point you can stick it all in the fridge overnight or not. Makes Cookies spread less. Kids won't care or give you the respect you deserve

--------------
BAKE

I make slightly larger than golf ball size scoops on a backing tray

Bake 11-14 Minutes. Watch for the bottom of the cookie to turn a little brown

Let the cookies rest a few minutes before moving because they are soft as clarts",1

1 large white onion, sliced very thin 
1 tomato, diced 
1 cup fresh orange juice (no pulp!) 
1 lime juice (at least 2 limes worth, we used 5 for our liking ) 
1/2 a bunch of cilantro chopped 
A squeeze of ketchup (or more based on taste) 
A drizzle of olive oil 

Plantain chips/tostones/patacones or popcorn on the 
side. 

1. After slicing the onion, sprinkle with salt and half a lime’s worth of juice. Use the palm of your hands to press onions to make thin and more transparent, almost like a kneading motion. Set aside. 

2. Cook shrimp by simmering in a pot of “3 fingers” of water. After cooking, set shrimp aside and SAVE THE WATER they were cooked in. Stick the water in the fridge to cool down. 

3. In a large bowl combine orange juice, lime
juice (start with 2 or 3 limes’ worth- can always add more as needed), onions, tomato, and cilantro, some or all of the cooled down shrimp water (to taste), and the squeeze of ketchup. Can also add a little black pepper if desired. 

4. Stir to combine, add cooked shrimp and a drizzle of olive oil. 

5. Chill before serving 

Serve with plantain chips or popcorn + avocado slices. 
*****
This is a VERY popular dish in Ecuador, but of course you will see regional differences. For example in the province of Manabi they add peanut butter and use no ketchup, while in the Andes region popcorn is used more commonly than plantains as a topping. There are also different ceviches served with fish, octopus, and even clams. 

This is traditionally eaten as a brunch entree (early lunch) or as an appetizer to a bigger meal. It’s energizing and commonly used as a hangover cure.",1

If you have a noodle bar or any kind of viet restaurant and wondering if you should go, I say yes you should go ASAP. Ask the server for something in your taste preference (heat or no heat)

If you get Pho, use the herbs, ask the server how to use them. OMG the flavor explosion in your mouth is wonderful!",1

Anyway, nice photo👍. Never seen that type of salt (apparently Himalayan) before.",1
9891,"Little note:

I'm Italian and I've never been to Belgium before. What, or better, who convinced me to try cooking this dish was actually a Flemish friend of mine who kept talking about this traditional Belgian dish, and since it looked and sounded pretty delicious I decided to make it today. I want to stress the fact that this was my first try with this kind of stew, I actually don't know what the real thing tastes like so this was kind of a guessing game for me, sorta, though, I'm very open to suggestions and critiques. :)

[Edit]:

I forgot to say that he and his father ""reviewed"" my dish, even though we live in two separate countries: the sauce is a little too runny but the rest is fine. Tastewise they will never know for obvious reasons. In my opinion it low-key reminds me of Lombard Cassoeula, which is another traditional stew made in the Italian region of Lombardy, the region where I live.",1
9892,I’m not sure about the bigger chunks but wagyu fat melts at a lot lower temp than regular beef fat. It’s more buttery. In shabu shabu it just kind of melts into the meat instantly. And in Korean barbecue the whole piece of meat kind of turns transparent. Drooling thinking about it.,1
9894,I toasted some last night with brie and red pepper jelly. Can confirm: was really good!,1
9895,Good choice! I was just hoping it wasn’t ketchup.,1

9904,Where did all these people come from who salt and pepper their eggs in the pan? Seems silly to do it before it's on the plate.,1
9905,Oh damn. This would make the best cheese toast!,1
9906,I guess you're having crunchy pink eggs for breakfast,1
9907,"Why do people seem to think it's a hotdog?

It's simply a sausage because I cooked that and some bacon before doing the eggs.",1
9908,Ya this is like 50 cents of eggs lol,1
9909,That's a healthy amount of onions. Looks great!,1
9910,The most important tip is don't try to be a hero by growing your own. Get a starter from someone. Usually people give them away for a small fee. Once you have that starter I go with the following: 4-5 bags of black or green tea (without any perfume or other additives). And stick to 1 that sort of tea once you decided. For 4-5 bags I use 100g of sugar. Brown sugar works way better in my opinion. Then just cook the tea by adding 1.5L of whater and bringing that to a simmer. Let that tea cool down completely before combining it with your starter. I usually let that mixture sit for about 1 week (maybe a little longer for the very first batch). When it's ready (I taste it with a straw) just save some liquid plus the starter for your next batch. If you have any other questions feel free to ask.,1
9911,I've tried that before with glad plastic wrap and to me the wrap looked like it was deteriorating and left little flakes of plastic. Water was below simmering temp,1

10123,I work at a ritzy country club. A while back they decided it was a good idea to put electronic salt and pepper grinders on all the tables. There are alot of old members. They would twist the grinders instead of pushing the button on the top. Meals ruined in this exact fashion was a daily occurrence. I started throwing them away one by one.,1

10143,I'd be salty aff,1
10145,That’s why you sorinkle the salt!,1
10146,Has happened to me as well with scrambled eggs. My friends still joke that I can’t taste salt and always overdo it,1
10147,Thanks! Usually they are a little flatter. This batch I did after resting the dough in the fridge overnight to see if that really made a difference to taste and texture. Turns out the kids didn't give a care either way,1

10154,I love biryani and this looks great. How did you manage to get such colorful rice?,1
10155,No recipe = was not great,1
10156,Yup! Hot stones come to the table in a lot of high end (and possibly normal) Japenese restaurants so customers can sizzle their wagyu away at their leisure. Really is a memorable thing to do.,1

I had some bacon cooking in the oven while I cooked the beef through in the skillet then I added cauliflower rice for more body and seasoned with my favorite set of spices: salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I added a little bit of chopped lettuce, then I poured it in a pie pan. 
Since this is basically a deconstructed burger, you can add any of your favorite toppings on it. I added sliced roma tomatoes and sharp cheddar cheese. 
While it sat in the oven for the cheese to melt I cooked the eggs and the husband made the sauce: mayo, ketchup, finely diced pickles, and onion powder.
Then assemble! Cheeseburger pie, bacon, egg, sauce, done! Took about half an hour and it was delicious.",1

10247,"To get the entire steak up to an exact temperature, imagine how good that is for a thick cut like this if you wanted it medium-rare the whole way through, it's a good idea to sear it both sides first yes, but you mostly want that for flavour rather than a need to seal the meat.",1
10249,yeah this is the best one i’ve ever done. the pan was up to almost 650 degrees on my IR thermometer. I think I set off every smoke alarm in the neighborhood.,1

10471," It's always challenging to use seitan! However, I had an idea, I tried to make an Indian delicious dish! I have to say the result was impressively yummy! So,

WHAT'S IN THERE?

20mins

300g of Basmati rice

The same volume of water as the rice

150g of Seitan

1 Leek

2 curry spoons

200ml of Coconut milk

Olive oil

Ginger

Spicy pepper

Salt.

COOKING STEPS:

Put the Basmati rice in a pan, cover with water, make it boil and cook for 10 minutes more or less.

Meanwhile, put olive oil in a pan, put pepper, cut leeks in circular slices, cut seitan in cubes, add the leeks, fry them a bit, add the Seitan, fry It a bit and add water.

Then add coconut milk, add curry, mix it, cook it a bit, add ginger and then cook it until it becomes Creamy, approx 5/10 mins.

Eat with hungriness.

LITTLE FUNNY FOOD FACT:

Did you know that Seitan is coming from China? It's an aliment full of proteins and made out of the gluten of the wheat

Furthermore, it had the advantage that it is already cooked, therefore it's cooking time is very fast!

10531,You planning on feeding an entire army there?,1
10532,"Try something like a chuck or round steak (131 degrees) or pork shoulder (140-145) for 30 hours ish. Allow it to cool a bit, slice it like an inch thick, and sear as you would any other steak. Turns cheap meat into something tender and amazing. 

It's also great for things like eggs. You can  perfectly soft boil, or make an ""egg bite"" type thing that's like a scrambled egg but velvety and perfectly cooked.

And don't get me started on things like quinoa or vegetables - can be cooked so they're no longer tough, but not yet soggy.

I cook my ribeyes/strips to a medium because I really want the fat on the outside to render and get crispy.  I do tenderloins rare, they can't take too much cooking because they aren't very fatty.   Things like strip, hangar, etc - I try to go rare on those, but with how thin they are it's hard to keep them rare on the inside while also getting some char on the outside edges.

It's a good read about the science behind it, why it's a preferred method, and the full instructions.

Essentially you slow cook the steak in an oven and take it out 5 degrees below your desired temp. Have your cast iron pan piping hot with some oil and sear both sides for about 60 seconds each. You also add butter, garlic, thyme or rosemary sprig when you flip the steak and baste it. That couple minutes of searing will get that steak 5 degrees hotter and at just the right temp.

I let the well done piece sit out until it had cooled to the same temp as the rare one. I put a little butter on top like normal so that you couldn’t tell which one was more dry and did a blind folded taste test. And as to be expected she picked the rare one as “the better tasting well done one”.  The look of horror when she took the blind fold off and the “medium” one turned out to be rare and sitting in a pool of its own blood and juices. That’s what gets people is the mental gymnastics of it. Their brain says “not cooked can’t eat it” if they see pink or the blood on the plate. 

The more you cook a steak and the more dry it gets the less taste and nutrients it has. Now for some people they really do enjoy a more palatable less flavorful stead. Just like some people really hate when seafood tastes “too fishy” when others think it tastes just fine.",1

Lets start with the octopus, obviously. I bought one frozen, it was about 1,5kg but I am guessing 1,2/1,2kg after defrosting it. If you buy one fresh you should put it into a freezer at least 3/4hours (better overnight). I like to keep the skin on anything but the head and a bit under that, it helps keeping it together (suckers and all).

As you might now freezing it helps tenderize the meat. I don't like my octopus to be too soft though, I want it to have a bite without being tough or chewy.

This one came out rather perfect, it all comes down to cooking time. I live in Italy and in the south they swear by the ""no water method"". That would be octopus with just some olive oil in a tight pot with the lid on. It will cook in its own juices rather well. 

I believe this method is better suited when you want to add some tomatoes or some sort of sauce. That is because cooked this way the octopus can be quite salty and the marinade wouldn't be able to deal with that. So I boiled it. You want to get the water to a boil and then, with some tongs, submerge the octopus 3 or 4 times.

The thermal shock should help with the meat as well, but what it surely does is curling the tentacles. That makes it prettier (in my opinion) and easier to handle. Then you just boil it for 1hr (you need to adjust the cooking time depending on the weight, usually it is 1hour per kg, but i prefer 45mins. In fact I did 1hr per 1,3kg).

You can check it with a skewer, you need to be able to penetrate the meat easily but with some resistance. People like to let the octopus cool down in its cooking water. I never had good results with that, the hot water keeps cooking the poor guy and you will end up with an overcooked octopus.

If you want to let it cool this way you need to stop before the 45mins per kg mark. As for me, I want to be sure I cooked it as much as I wanted. So take it out and let it cool on a rack or a colander or a plate. 

When it is lukewarm/amb temp you can cut off the head and split it in 2, then cut the tentacles and keep them whole. Prepare a simple marinade with extra evo and lemon juice (one lemon and about the same amount of oil, maybe a bit less), add salt, pepper and roughly chopped parsley. Mix it in a bowl and then give the octopus pieces a nice coating. Put a lid on it and store it in the fridge for about 30mins (we don't marinade this for long because the lemon would cook the octopus too much).

You can grill this on anything you want, an iron grill on the stove, a wood or charcoal fire, an electrical grill. For me it was the day after Easter and it's tradition here to have some sort of barbecue. I had some nice cherry wood chunks and I prepared a nice and smoky fire. You want to grill each side for about 4/5 minutes and use some of the marinade to wet the tentacles during the process, so that they don't become dry.

What you want to achieve is a nice smoky/grilled flavor with a bit of a crunch at the end of the tentacles. 

Some of these techniques are good for cooking octopus in general, but in this case it is specifically tailored for a grilled one. It's really simple and quick to do (it looks a lot worse when written, classic ""easier done than said"" scenario), it's light and you can have a barbecue even without meat if you want.

Hope this was helpful and I am glad you enjoyed my food. Cheers!",1

3 Large 28oz Cans of Las Palmas Green Enchilada Sauce

16oz Chicken Bone Broth or Stock

32oz Cooked Northern White Beans

32oz Cooked Canelli Beans

2lbs Browned Ground Turkey or Shredded Rotisserie Chicken 

One large Onion

Carrots

Yellow Squash

One Small Can Green Chili’s of desired heat 

Salt, Pepper, Garlic, Chicken Adobo Seasoning

Toppings: Cheese, Sour Cream, Diced Onions, Fritos


This is the typical base, I added sautéed carrots and yellow squash to this one but you are only limited by your imagination.

Brown Ground Turkey and add diced onion, carrots, and squash.  Cook until onions are translucent.  Add liquids and beans and simmer for 15mins, season to personal taste.  Top with sour cream, cheese, diced onion, and Fritos.

11273,"Ok, to be clear I’m a cook not a photographer. What I think you want to be doing with your plating for a dish like this is threefold. First, I wouldn’t put the protein directly on top of all that purée, what I would do is take a very large spoonful and put it in one corner of the plate and use the back of the spoon to push some of it to the other side of the plate so it thins out.(I’ll post a photo to show you what I mean.)Second, this your plate is square I’d line the placement of the food on a diagonal from corner to corner, rather than side to side.  Lastly, I’d try to make the veggies a bit more vertical(think like a teepee) to give the plate some height. And, on a flavor note you might not want to have a light protein like the tuna directly on top of the purée as it might dampen the flavor of such a delicious fish.",1

You're right though, I've been exploring other meats. Chicken breast and pork chops, which usually come out too dry are amazing sous vide. You can't have that med/med.rare texture cooked with any other method since you have to hit 165F all the way through on pork and chicken.

1 pound of shoyu poke (for a family of five) 
1 package of wonton wrappers (cut in half into triangles)
Kewpie mayonnaise
Sriracha
Wasabi
Sesame oil
Sesame seeds
Green onions
Avocado

I fried the wonton wrappers in hot oil for around 5 seconds per side. Put them on a brown paper bag and salted them. I mixed up the mayonnaise, Sriracha, and sesame oil (in descending amounts) as well as mayonnaise, wasabi, and sesame oil to make the two sauces. Then I just threw it all together!

It should be a soup, not a sauce. It should be thick, but everything fully covered sitting in it. 

Jambalaya has the rice cooked in the broth, it’s based on paella. So the rice is all soaked in the broth and flavors of the vegetables and meats, plus it ends up dry and more like a sauce rather than a soup. There shouldn’t be a roux for it. It’s not the same.",1

Then i just rolled it into 2 thin pieces, coat bottom with egg, cheese layer, sausage (or ham if you got any) , your preference of spices, then another layer of cheese.

I melt butter, pour it over a cold 1.5-2 inch thick ribeye or better, let it come close to room temp, press fresh ground black pepper into it, sear it in a very very hot cast iron for about a minute, sear the sides, then throw the pan in an oven at 450 for about 3 minutes per side.

Sometimes I sear onion and peppers in a second pan and throw them on top when I plate it.

For containers you can use a pot, but consider upgrading to a specialized container as it makes life much easier. Just read up on sous vide recipes like on anova's website or kenji lopez-alt's recipes.

My favorite things to cook are new york strip, ribeyes, chicken breast, and pork chops. It's amazing eating a pork chop medium/med. rare and chicken to 145 degF. Since you otherwise can't cook those below 165degF which makes them super dry.",1

First I made the dough with semolina, 00, buckwheat and eggs. Yes, I experimented with all the above for colour, texture and taste. Then I rolled the dough with my Marcodo Atlas 150 to No 6 so it’s really thin hence reducing cooking time. Then I rolled the dough sheets with a textured dough rolling pin. Then I cut the sheets into small, fluted rounds of 2”? Finally I shaped each small dough disc into a tiny grey rose. 

I had a great time practicing to be a future “pasta granny”...... They took bloody long to make!  The perfect new project to learn during lockdown. 🥴👍🤪

I made a simple sauce with tomato, garlic, sweet basil and some Spanish anchovies. To add extra protein, I fried some tuna with some Italian seasoning.

2 tbsp brown sugar
A thumb size piece of ginger (grated)
5 cloves of garlic (I just used preminced)
Salt and pepper to taste

I marinated for 4 hours and hit it on the grill for about 15 minutes. Boiled the remaining marinade to kill any raw bacteria and basted them like barbecue sauce.

* 8 bone in skin on chicken drumsticks or thighs
* oil
* 6 garlic gloves, peeled and roughly chopped
* 1 cup dry white wine
* 2 limes, juice of
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 1 bunch of coriander, roughly chopped, plus a bit extra to garnish

&amp;#x200B;

Spice Mix:

* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 tsp paprika powder
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* 1 tbsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg

&amp;#x200B;

Steps:

1. Preheat your oven to 190 C
2. In a small bowl, mix the spices. Pat the chicken dry and season on all sides with the spice mix. Allow to stand at room temp for around 15 min.
3. Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet with a lid (I just use tin foil as the lid). Brown the chicken on all sides and then remove from the skillet.
4. Lower the heat and pour in the white wine. Allow to simmer and reduce slightly, then add the broth.
5. Bring liquid to a simmer and add lime juice and garlic.
6. Return the chicken to the skillet and add the coriander. Bring to a high simmer for 5 minutes or so.
7. Put the lid (tinfoil) on and transfer to the pre-heated oven. 
8. Allow to cook for 30-45 min, or until the chicken is cooked through.
9. Remove from the oven, remove chicken and set aside.
10. Thicken the sauce with cornflour. Put chicken back in and sprinkle with a bit more coriander as a garnish.
11. Serve on rice (or whatever).
12. Put in mouth. Enjoy.",1

The steak in this picture is close to, but not, “rare”.",1

Buy yourself a sous vide tool. Put some butter and fresh herbs in there and cook it to the proper temp (130-140 for rare or medium rare).

Once it's done, it will look sad. Make sure you have a cast iron to the highest setting you can muster. Dry your meat.

Sear on both sides for a few seconds. We're going for beauty here. Every second you spend on the fire, you're going past the perfect temp you wanted.

Once done, serve. Do a cross section cut and post to Reddit/Imgur/etc. for maximum karma/fake point accumulation.

11587,"So I used this simple Philadelphia cheesecake filling recipe [here](https://www.myfoodandfamily.com/recipe/051208/philadelphia-3-step-cheesecake). I added the zest of half a lemon and a tiiiny squeeze of lemon to give it some brightness. For the crust, I used 10 sheets of cinnamon graham crackers pulverized with 5 tbs melted butter and 1/3 cup granulated sugar patted this into a springform pan and baked at 300 degrees for 10 minutes. Then, added the filling and baked at 325 for 40 minutes. Tbh I didn’t do a water bath and really didn’t have any cracks, not that it matters because you’re adding the dulce de leche on top! For that, put a can of condensed milk (without the wrapper) on its side in a pot with water filled about 2 inches above the can. Heat and simmer on medium-high heat for 2.5 hours. Let cool, then spoon on to cheesecake and cool in the fridge for at least 4 hours. Sprinkle sea salt on top and enjoy!",1

11632,"I totally agree. Even if I’m using a grill, I’ll put a cast iron pan onto the grill. Gives it a little bit of smoky flavor, but you also get the nice sear from the cast iron. Best of both worlds.",1
11634,"I’m taken, but depending on your baking skills maybe we can get a thruple situation going..",1
11635,"So this steak is definitely closer to the rare side of medium rare. The center 50% or so is def straight up rare. The outside 10% is well, and about 20% is medium and the remaining 20% is true medium rare. 

I would usually grill my steaks like this but slightly closer to medium spectrum but definitely still medium rare.

I have recently started using an immersion circulator to cook steaks at 131-132degF and it’s unbelievable how the entire steak is true medium rare except the seared edges. The texture is incomparable. No part of the steak looks like the middle of this steak but the entire thing is just past the point of being translucent but still red.

Anyone that’s on the fence about Sous vide should try it out. I still like grilling once in a while just to prove to myself I know how to grill a med rare steak, but for those who poke medium rare you have to try Sous vide. It’s actually very easy and foolproof.",1

11662,"I grew up hating steaks. turns out they are t supposed to be cooked until they are rubber. that's how my mom liked it and my dad couldn't be arsed to cook it differently for each person. wasn't until I was older when. I tried a steak at a restaurant medium rare for shits. Fucking loved it!

no I cook steaks a lot but in a pan due to being in an Apt. (no BBQ allowed on patios). my fav part is converting BBQ steak loves to the cast iron steak lol. BBQ is great bust is doest beat a steak baated in butter with roasted garlic gloves and Thyme. imo of course.",1

 It's pretty entertaining eating food like in the way it is usually eaten in those parts of the world, where the  flatbread is used to scoop up the food and place it in your mouth like a small taco, albeit a little messy.",1

11819,"&gt; My understanding was that resting it was more so to retain the juices, but I've always done it this way so idk haha

This is 100% true, but not the only reason to rest at this stage of a reverse sear. Home stovetops don't reach temps high enough to obliterate the surface of a steak in seconds like commercial hardware. If the area just under the surface is still hot when it hits the pan, its going to overcook by the time you get the color you want. Resting lets you reach that point while keeping the inside the desired temp throughout.",1

11895,What cheese did you use,1
11896,Extra virgin burns anything else probably won’t. I feel like a good percentage of people on earth fry and sear in olive oil and if nobody ever told them it wasn’t ideal they’d never know. It’s slightly wasteful only because you can fry and sear in cheaper oil but any refined oil will work the same.,1

Source: https://butterwithasideofbread.com/snickerdoodle-apple-cobbler/

Ingredients

1/2 cup softened butter

1/2 cup shortening I used butter flavored Crisco

1 1/2 cups sugar

2 eggs

1 TBSP vanilla

2 3/4 cups flour

2 tsp cream of tartar

1 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp salt

cinnamon-sugar mixture 1/2 cup sugar + 2 TBSP cinnamon

2 20- oz cans apple pie filling

caramel sauce for topping

Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a 9x13 glass pan with non-stick cooking spray. (If using a darker pan, decrease temp to 350°F)

Cream together butter, shortening, 1 1/2 cups sugar, the eggs and the vanilla. Blend in the flour, cream of tartar, soda and salt.

Take about 2/3 of the snickerdoodle dough and press it flat into the bottom of the 9x13 pan, pressing against the edges so that they rise just a bit around the sides of the pan. Sprinkle half the cinnamon sugar mixture on top of the dough. Spread both cans of apple pie filling over the dough, making sure it extends to all sides. Take the remaining cookie dough and crumble it with your fingers, placing small pieces covering the top of the apple pie filling. It won't completely cover it, but it will be close. Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture on top.

Cover cobbler with foil. (I sprayed the side that would be touching the cobbler with non-stick spray.) Bake at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes on the middle rack of the oven. Remove foil and bake another 10 minutes. 

Let cool for 10 minutes and serve, topped with caramel sauce if desired. Or a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then caramel sauce. Mmmmm!",1

12020,"For those like me who were unfamiliar with this and want to know how it works, saving you a click from wikipedia:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The pinkish color in meat is typically due to the presence of a compound called [myoglobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoglobin).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_ring_(cooking)#cite_note-Franklin_Mackay_2015_p._251-2) Myoglobin typically darkens and turns brown when heated above a certain temperature.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_ring_(cooking)#cite_note-Franklin_Mackay_2015_p._251-2) This is why the perimeter of a cooked steak is darker in color than the red inside; as the lower temperature of the middle of the steak was not sufficient to cause the myoglobin to lose its pigment.  
&gt;  
&gt;When smoking meat, a different process occurs than in other cooking methods. Organic fuels such as wood and charcoal, when burned, produce [nitrogen dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide) (NO2) gas. When this gas dissolved into the meat, it reacts with the hydrogen molecules and becomes [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide) (NO). The NO combined with the myoglobin form a stable pink molecule that does not denature in the heat. The depth of the smoke ring is determined by how far the smoke can permeate into the meat.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_ring_(cooking)#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_ring_(cooking)#cite_note-4)

* 2 packs of Costco boneless-skinless chicken thighs (like 3 lbs)

* 2 TBSP oil
* 5 clove garlic (crushed)
* 1/3 jar apricot preserves (don;t need this just happened to have it and sounded good
* 1 TBSP rice wine vinegar (or cider/white)
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp ginger power (use equivalent fresh if you have it)
* Salt/Pepper to taste
* Green onions would be good on this if you have them

Mix all ingredients and add chicken. Marinate 1-24 hours. Add to oven safe pan and bake at 425F for 20-25 minutes flipping twice. Broil for 3-5 minutes or until sauce has reduced and caramelizes. Serve on what ever you think sounds good",1

12198,"Our NHL team’s arena served poutine with pulled pork - I went to one game a year and looked forward to that almost as much as the game itself.

I managed to get to a game this season before the shutdown, and went straight for the poutine...but - they’d changed it.  Subbed battered and fried green beans for the fries in an attempt to make it ‘healthy’...

I was crushed.

I still bought it...but it was $12 of disappointment.

Yours looks worse, and actually makes me mad.  

That’s not poutine, it’s a pig with lipstick.  r/onionhate",1

12205,"For your presentation of this finished steak- the way you cut it is fine. 

Your cut shows the temperature of the steak. And IMO you have a beautiful tenderloin and have cooked it really well.

Cutting against the grain would be more applicable on a flank steak where cutting against the grain would help with the texture. A nice tenderloin doesn’t need help it’s already a perfect texture.",1

For that reason I think the whole ""well they know what's going on so we shouldn't eat them"" isn't a great argument. Animals get eaten alive everyday by other animals that are fully aware of what's going on, but that's just nature and nature just be a bitch like that sometimes.",1

12231,I will investigate i still have other leftover that are raw. They were sold as ribeyes.,1

If you like Nutella and have never tried it spread on a cinnamon graham, please allow me to share with you the good news about this snack. I’m not even a huge Nutella freak, but it’s magic combined with a cinnamon graham cracker .",1
12255,It's the type of food for game night n beers!,1
12257,"Ingredients:
1kg chuck steak, diced and floured

1 large brown onion

2 cloves garlic, minced

2 large carrots, chopped

3 celery stalks, chopped

4 cups beef stock

2 cans Guinness

200g mushrooms, hacked to pieces

Worcestershire sauce*

Tomato paste*

Thyme*

Rosemary*

Salt*

Pepper*

Brown the beef then set aside and try not to snack on it while you sautee onions, garlic, mushrooms, carrots and celery together. Add the stock and Guinness and return the beef to the pan, and add the rest of the ingredients recklessly because you've had a few testing sips of the Guinness and as long as it tastes good a bit of reckless seasoning never hurt. 

Leave to simmer for a couple of hours and then turn into a pie as leftovers a couple days later with last night's mashed potatoes, sprinkled liberally with mozzarella and tasty cheese. Brush pie with milk to get it brown and nice!

u/Michaelalayla hope this helps",1

12377,Funny how just north of Maine is Nova Scotia and they eat it hot with butter too.,1
12378,"You need a digital thermometer. Time is a bad way to judge how long to cook a steak, aside from a rough estimate.

Reasons why:

What temp are you cooking at?

How thick is the pan you're cooking on, what material is it?

How thick is the steak?

All these things affect the tone required to bring the steak to a specific temperature. That's why cooking guides that say ""get your pan hot then sear the steak x minutes then flip and sear x more minutes"" will never end with a consistent result for other people.

Using a digital instant read thermometer will take all the guesswork out. A medium rare steak is a steak with an internal temperature around 130°F, give or take a few degrees.

Once you can get that result consistently, it's easier to work on other parts of your steak game, like getting a crust.",1
12379,Perfectly cooked but you cut it with the grain.,1
12380,"Yeah I definitely wouldn't recommend it unless you have at least a medium-sized kitchen hood haha. I would compare it to butter in that the flavor it imparts is worth the trade-off in smoke point, at least in my opinion, and in this specific application",1

I’ve been training for ~6 yrs off and on and Since I’ve started following Greg Doucette’s advice I’ve had the easiest time going from 200 lbs. (January 1,2020) to 180 as of this week. COVID has slowed my progress but I’m only 10-15 lbs away from my goal and it’s only been 4.5 months.",0

Your overall strength gains would be slowed but not lost. But if you’re not training for endurance, strength, muscle, stamina, etc..... then increasing the volume really won’t lead to anything. I think if you did like a combo of both. Maybe increase the volume and lower the intensity with exercises with like pushups and crunches or whatever exercises you’re doing of that nature. And keep the intensity on higher conditioning exercises to at least gain some cardio benefits to help you with swimming and surfing once you can return to the water.

12515,"It’s hard. I took 3 days of rest when I should have been working out because of it. My advice is to just do something. On the third day I put on my clothes and went down to my treadmill. And you know what, I was too depressed to move, I had an overwhelming feeling of I don’t want to. I felt guilty though and I didn’t want to lose my progress, so I did some weighted lunges. No more than 30 seconds, I didn’t even break I sweat. Then I felt like hey that wasn’t even anything and I have nothing better to do. So I opened up a hiit workout on my phone and did about a third. 

First of all, don’t expect something of yourself that day. I always do two things when I workout and I’m very meticulous about them; run a mile, and finish whatever workout I start. If I say 30 reps and my legs are about to explode my ocd gives me the power to finish. But like you saw, in that day I didn’t force myself. I did whatever I was ok for. Cardio was not in the book, but something fast seemed more tolerable. 

Second of all start small. If I just did 30 seconds of lunges, good. I forced myself to move; forget what I did. Just force yourself to do something (even 5 pushups), and I’m not saying it will immediately be easy, but one day you’ll feel like you want to do more and it will work itself out",0

12523,"For the most part I think this is fairly well written and simple (keeping it simple is good) First, I think you could mix it up a little bit more for your legs unless you have limitations as to what you can do. If not, I would apply some things like squats with your KTB or maybe just body weight or with a backpack. As well, maybe try some different push up and pull up variations of you want to make them more dynamic and challenging. But mainly the problem with body weight exercises is placing a set rep goal like your 8-12 will only work for so long. 8-12 may be challenging right now but you’ll eventually get to a point where it’s no longer enough to get bigger/stronger. So I would advice either simply taking reps to failure or making your workouts work with a time limit to make you work harder in a certain amount of time. Hope this is helpful, best of luck!",0

12545,"Technically yes. You can literally sit on your ass all day and lose weight if you reduce your calories enough. I wouldn’t recommend it because that calorie amount is very low and you’re probably used to eating much more than that. Three minutes of working out at even the hardest intensity would burn maybe an extra 20 calories. Which won’t do much for you. The most important thing for losing fat is your diet, you need to be in a calorie deficit. After you have your diet down I’d recommend doing at least thirty minutes of exercise a day especially if you work a a sedentary job.",0

In your fitness journey, it’s a good idea to also focus on the strength/performance gains and how you look in the mirror to mark your progress.  Muscle holds more water and is heavier than fat, a big reason why we gain weight with resistance training.

If we want to get in depth why muscle begins to hold more water with training... as you train, your muscle “realizes” it needs to produce more ATP and Creatine Phosphate stores(back up energy for immediate use). With the increase of stored ATP and creatine phosphate, more water also needs to be stored to keep homeostasis within the muscle cells.",0

Here are my thoughts:

1. Become aware of the problem- what does your posture look like in a 24 hour period? Are you rounded forward when you work on the computer? Does your head protrude forward when you stand? Are you sleeping with 3 pillow?
2. Release the tight, short muscles that are assisting the rounding forward position. With the help of your own hand or a household ball (think baseball, lax ball or tennis ball) apply enough pressure to self massage and release tight muscle knots.
3. Build strength in the weak muscles that are supposed to properly support sound posture (glutes, core and back muscles). There are a ton of exercises I could recommend like ""prone cobras"" or ""alternating superman's"" but the key here is to do these exercises well. 

At this stage you are restructuring how your body is going to fundamentally work and it takes time and discipline. If you need more help just DM. Good luck!

12600,You’ll enjoy your body and exercise more if you just exercise to move your body in a fun way and love yourself the way you are.  Loosing weight alone does not make you healthier or happier. But moving your body and eating a wide variety of foods with good nutrients will make you healthier and happier.   Bring more joy to your body and let go of the judgement.  You don’t have to look a certain way to be worthy.,0

12603,What exactly do you do,0
12604,Thanks :) my glutes are at 37 inches rn and I want them so much bigger,0
12605,Congratulations!  You proved to yourself that you could do what you said you would do even though it was not as convenient as it could have been.,0
12607,"I’m the same way. Being a “crossfitter” a lot of workouts are “for time.” I can’t get past the need to want to go fast every time. 

I just have to find something comfortable and go with it. Usually the first 1/2 mile I hear my split and have to pump the breaks a little. I always come out hot.",0
12608,"Honestly, just walking around may be your best option. But if you want a little bit more of a challenge, try doing carries. Either with proper weights or with just some relatively heavy things you have in your home you can carry. Dedicate two spots in your home, places the “weights” at one spot in the house and carry them to the other spot. Then move them back, then back, then back. See how many times you can do this in say 30 minutes or however long you want and this should give you a fun little challenge for your body while getting in steps and staying indoors. Only thing you wanna be carrying the “weights” with good posture in whatever methods you use for carrying. Ideally the weights could be at least 10-12 lbs each ( they could vary from lighter and heavier objects) and if you had say 5 things to move from one spot to another and then back again. I once did this for fun with my fun home weight set and it took about 40 minutes and I was dripping sweat. It’s more fun than it sounds trust me. You may not get a ton of steps in but you’ll be working hard with each step compared to normal walking so it may lay off better even with less distance. Hope this is helpful, good luck!",0
12609,"If you try doing the 15 reps per set style, keep your rest time a set amount say 30 sec as an example. Then don’t focus on getting to a 100 total reps. Simply do your sets of 15 until you can’t do push ups anymore. That way you’re going to absolute failure. Hope this is helpful, good luck!",0
12610,"Do whatever challenges your muscle the most. If alternating is harder than do that, if you don’t want to alternate, you’re not going to loose any gains because of it. It’s a matter of effort and challenge. Challenge your muscles, push to failure, don’t be afraid to mix it up, and have fun with it, and you’ll be fine. Hope this is helpful, best of luck!",0
12611,"Tingly could be a bad sign that a nerve is a being bothered by something in your back. I would easy back on the training a bit maybe just do light things like (however boring it may be) walking around your home. I would avoid any unnecessary lower back aggregation to prevent anything from getting worse. I would maybe try increasing your mobility in your hips and shoulders/upper spine, and neck. That way maybe you can easy up any pressure your lower back is enduring. Lastly try strengthening your glutes (medius/Maximus) they’ll again help support your back and make take away some pressure. (You can find plenty of YouTube clips on how to do that) As well, trying massaging your lower back muscles with either someone’s help if with a tennis ball on the sides of your lower back. The tingly discomfort could potentially be caused by nerve irritation like I said but I am not a doctor this is just my best guess. These are just general things you can try to relieve your symptoms and hopefully not make things worse. But best, when time is right, you get checked out by a doctor. Hope this is helpful, best of luck to you!",0

12614,"There are plenty more exercises you can do such as: Squats, lunges, weighted push ups (with backpack), you can use a backpack or wrap something heavy in a towel and and then use the towel as handles for bent over rows, and many more. YouTube there are tons of different exercise demos that you can do with minimal supplies. But to make your workouts more intense overall, I would recommend making them shorter. Keep your rest periods short and keep your body working whether you’re going through one exercise or through a cycle of a few. Either way, you increase the amount of work your body does by decreasing the time it takes you to do a certain amount of reps for an exercise.
Example Plan: 
Your challenge is to do 100 push ups, 150 crunches, and 200 squats, in say 20 minutes. Time yourself and see how long it takes you. Say you do it in 17 minutes. Next time you do that workout your goal is to do it in 15 minutes. This way the work load your body experiences is high than before. This creates a challenge for your muscle that can result in muscle growth. 
Hope this is helpful, good luck!",0

2. rotation - woodchops with a band, side on ball throw, Russian twist
3. anti-rotation - these are your plank variations - high/low, side, spidermans etc.

Big full body exercises like squats, push ups, deadlifts use the core as well, so I always put them into a program for clients.",0

As for crunches, they're generally fine if done properly, but there are better core exercises out there.

12637,"It’s not necessarily a bad combo to diet and gain muscle. Its just kind of hard to do both at the same time. It’s definitely a good thing to eat healthy nutritious foods and exercise! However, if your main goal is to gain muscle mass you have to eat a higher amount of calories for your body to grow those muscles. And if your main goal is to lose weight you need to eat less amount of calories than you are expending. You can certainly lose a bit of weight while gaining muscle but muscle weighs more than fat does so you won’t see a huge difference when you go to weigh yourself on a scale so just be mindful of that. Sometimes it’s better to not even weigh yourself and just go off of how you are feeling on the inside and out.  It’s a little confusing, but if you are consistently exercising/weight training and eating healthy foods you should be able to lose a bit of fat and gain muscle. I would say if your main focus is growing the glutes then just focus on those specific glute exercises and do them 3-4 times a week. If you have an instagram follow @bootyking ! He has the best workouts and gives lots of tips on how to grow your glutes, gain muscle, and lose fat.",0
12638,Bret is THE person to follow. He just made a post about the dos and don’ts of growing your glutes. All his posts have tons on information. I would also follow @glute.guru because he also posts great info/workouts. Just remember not to get discouraged!! Idk how long you’ve been working out for but the booty transformations that they post take years to come to being. You have to stay consistent with your workouts. I wish you all the booty gains!!,0
12639,Blogilates.com has many different booty videos. So you can work on toning ALL different parts of the glutes. They’re all between 5-15min each so you can mix and match everyday and not end up doing the same routine everyday.,0

12641,"Not OP but yeah, it's not the best combo. It's practically impossible to gain muscle on a caloric deficit. That being said, if you have a significant amount of fat you'd like to lose, I'd suggest you focus on that first. Eat right and exercise regularly, and by the time you lose the fat your butt will be toned and ready to grow. On the other hand, if you'd only like to drop a couple of pounds, I'd probably jump straight to building mass, but that might just be a personal preference.

As for exercises, I agree that your routine shouldn't be just squats. Personally I struggle with glute activation in most exercises, but hip thrusts always seem to hit the spot.",0
12642,"Agreed. I’ll take a multiple mile run in the cold outdoors over a mile on my treadmill. For me, it’s all about varying incline and pace. There’s no way I could stick to one pace for more than 10 minutes without wanting to off myself. Also, try HIIT style runs on the treadmill.

I started doing 100 push-ups a day and trying to do this for 30 day’s to start. When I started, I could only do 20 straight with proper form. 15 days later, this is now up to 40. After that the number in the set drops but I can get to 100 in about 3.5 minutes.",0

If you’re eating the same amount as you are used to you will maintain weight, and if you are eating more calories and incorporating glute excercises you will make gains in the glutes. I Also recommend incorporating hip thrusts, single leg glute bridges, and lunges. Squats are mainly quad dominant and although they are a great exercise for your body, doing only squats will not get you the booty gains you’re looking for. Hope this helps!",0

12668,"If you’re finding your hip flexors take over in sit ups or crunches try squeezing a foam roller between your heels and your glutes while doing the crunch. This will switch on your hamstrings, and due to reciprocal inhibition your hip flexors will have a harder time switching on. 

In terms of planking and similar movements I’d suggest starting with some breathing work so you can learn what it feels like to activate your core musculature. Lie on your back, bend your hips up to 90 and bend your knees to 90 (you can place the soles of your feet on wall or lay your shins across a chair or box or something). Think about crushing your belly button into the floor, and try to breathe while doing this. If you’re doing it properly you’ll feel your core firing to maintain the brace position. You can then progress this by moving into a hollow body position, always focusing on crushing your belly button into your spine.",0
12669,"There is a couple of things I get my clients to do. 

1. Put your hand over your belly button take a deep breath in. Breathe out sharply and brace your abs like you're about to be punched.
2. Put your hands on the sides of your core, under the ribs. As you breathe in deep into the diaphragm, try to push the ""barrel"" of the core against your hands
3. When performing a crunch or reverse crunch, bring the ribs to the pelvis, or pelvis to the ribs by curling the lower/lumbar spine. If you stay flat, that's when the hip flexors take over

Try these, and let me know if you have any questions!",0

If you can switch up those reps to include exercises that aren't in your normal workout, or go slow and focus on eccentric/isometric movements, then you will introduce new muscle stimulus which should increase muscle density and performance.

There is a limit to how much muscle you can build doing body weight only workouts however, so if that is your specific goal the gym might be better for you long term. Unless you were using fairly heavy weights beforehand though you can definitely still advance at home.

If you can I recommend getting a pull up bar so you can work abs (hanging leg raises) or back with pull ups. You can even get creative and do other things with it. 

As for a routine and progression, I personally go to failure everytime on body weight. Also I follow Goggins rule of no rest days but that’s just me personally, you can do 6 on 1 off. 

As for legs and chest, you can find good routines on the internet, Like laying pec decks and incline bench press (I just sit in a chair and arch back) all of which can be done with dumbbells. And for legs dumbbell squats, dumbbell lunges, calf raises. 

And if your feeling it, you can even ass shoulders to back day and do shoulder press, lat raises, and shrugs. I recommended doing chest, back+shoulders, legs. All those days with abs and cardio after. 

Ofcourse this is all my opinion, but should give you a starting thought, I’ve followed this for two weeks and have been seeing nice results. You can check my page and see my bicep progress so far and down 5 lbs. I wish you the best of luck in your goals brother!",0

Exercises that are great for starting out are calisthenics (body weight exercises like pushups, pull-ups, and sit-ups), running (slow long distance runs, fast short distance runs, and short sprints all exercise your body differently and are all important). It doesn’t need to be complicated. Some days I literally just do a circuit of pushups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and run. 

Form is extremely important to exercise effectively and prevent injuries. 

PLEASE STRETCH. 
Flexibility is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Every fiber of your body is interconnected. People don’t realize how badly it messes you up to be all stiff. 
Yoga is your friend. 

Youtube is a great resource for learning exercises and learning good form.",0
12737,"Yeah you can’t target exercise, but I do recommend power yoga. It’s free and will help you build muscle in areas that may normally be neglected and can help a lot if you have “dead butt” syndrome or back or hip issues. I think yoga helps people develop that ideal shape, but it also helps you develop a more positive and aware relationship with your body and breathing. On YouTube try yoga with Adrienne or Alo Yoga",0
12738,You can also increase duration and intensity and that will help. Also try different types of cardio like stairs or bike if you have access.

12739,"Im fifteen rn but I started my journey at 14 when I was 125ish pounds and was 4’8 i just started with eating healthy foods, reducing the amount of junk food I ate to one item a week max.

Rn im 4’3 and 125ish pounds and I have just been constantly working for almost the past 2 years. You will have you ups and downs but all you need is determination and consistency to reach your goal.",0
12740,You can change training with frequency intensity duration and what type of exercise you're doing. General guidelines for health is 2-3 times a week resistance training doing 8-10 exercises covering all the major muscle groups 8-12 reps each. Then you want 150 min of moderate exercises per week or 75 min vigorous exercise. Of course you can do more than this. This is what's considered minimum for health benefits. You can alter these recommendations based on your ultimate goal.,0
12741,"I've been there, literally. I'm down about 120 lbs so far.  As people said, it's mostly diet.

I'm happy to help you out with basic diet shit and workout stuff. 

Do you have any medical things to think about? Prediabetic/diabetic, thyroid, pcos, chronic illness, etc.? They can all affect how to structure your macros in order to see the best and most sustainable weightloss.

12746,"Jeff Cavilere of Athleanx.com has some great videos online for good bodyweight movements to build muscle. There's typically a beginner version of the movement and an advanced one.

I personally recommend buying bands, a pull up bar, some dog leashes, a good backpack and some heavy things to put in the backpack. You can probably wait on most of this stuff until you get more familiar with it but you can tie the leashes to the backpack, throw them over the pull up bar as use this as a DIY cable machine for upper movements.

Another thing is making sure you get enough protein. 1g per lb of bodyweight is a good goal but if you're 20g or so under here or there, it'll be fine. Get some creatine monohydrate too, take it daily. You can load it of you want to. Caffeine is good but be careful with the dose and make sure you get enough sleep.

That's it really. There's more you could probably do but I think these things are the ones that will have the most impact. 

Go on YouTube and watch videos. There's a bunch of people who make videos that are junk and trying to sell you something. Well they all are but if you watch enough videos, you'll be able to tell who is honest and who isn't. Steroids is a big problem in the fitness industry and people like to imply that their products got them the results when it was really just steroids.

YouTubers I recommend: Jeff Cavilere, Jeff Nippard, Omar Isuf, Alan Thrall, Scott Herman, and maybe Joe Rogan although his would be just for general knowledge. Sometimes there's some misinformation on there buts good overall.

My #1 is Jeff Nippard although Jeff Cavilere has more content.

Once i was at the stage where i found those too low intensity i move to a higher intensity one and have lost 32 pounds so far... you can do it .. just start slow but follow a routine and eat right. Feel free to PM me if you want more details.

Most important thing is you have to eat right.",0
12768,"you're already underweight. underweight starts at bmi 18.4.

you can't spot reduce fat. working out your thighs will not reduce thigh fat. 

you can't gain any noticeable amount of muscle in three weeks. you can gain *at most* .25lb a week if you try really hard and get everything right. immediately after working out the body part that you worked out will appear bigger because of ""the pump"", where the muscle is swollen from exertion. that goes away in a few hours. since you're relatively new, you're probably also retaining water, which can make your legs look bigger. but that goes away in about [six weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ah4fau/psa_a_recent_increase_in_exercise_often_causes_a/).

how lean or flabby someone looks depends on their body fat percentage, not the actual number of pounds of fat they have. so you have two options: stay at the weight you're at and keep working out (gaining muscle and losing fat concurrently so you get leaner) or gain some weight in muscle (which will reduce your body fat percentage so you get leaner).

option a you eat at maintenance/don't lose or gain weight and keep working out.

option b you eat at a small surplus (100-200 calories) and keep working out.

i also recommend that you work out your whole body so everything stays in proportion with each other.",0

running ""reduces"" muscle by building slow-twitch muscle fibers (which are smaller). strength training and fast running both build up fast twitch muscle fibers, which are bigger. so you want to do long slow runs and have any strength training you do for your lower body be very high rep. the muscles may also shrink faster if you switch to walking. but you don't want to stop exercising your legs altogether because muscle takes up less space than fat and also has shape instead of just hanging off of you.

strength training your upper body (even simple things like push ups and pull ups, see r/bodyweightfitness for progressions if you can't do those) can also make you look more proportional, either by gaining muscle to balance it out or by not losing muscle from there. (if the only exercise you do is running, then your body will prioritize the muscle you use... which is your legs.)

Is it due to chest pain and other symptoms or are you just paranoid that something could happen? if you’re getting symptoms after 3 minutes of biking you should talk to your doctor just to make sure everything is fine before working out anymore. 

If you’re just paranoid, you should continue biking, maybe at a slower pace. biking is a great exercise for someone carrying a little extra weight as it’s better on your joints. Listen to your body while you’re biking...if you feel chest pain or extreme shortness of breath then take a break. but if you’re feeling fine then you have nothing to worry about!

12779,"I would recommend starting light and increasing over time. Weight loss is largely diet based, so finding a few things to improve in the diet is important while you’re commencing an exercise journey. As a starting point for exercise, I’d suggest walking as a starting point. You can go as fast or as slow as you like, and as far as you want. The main thing is to start moving, and over time your body will adapt and improve.

As you increase in fitness, you’ll find you’re able to jump on the exercise bike and train on that, and over time you’ll also find real benefits in resistance training too. 

If you’re set on push ups, you can do those by finding something to place your hands on, and starting in a more upright position. The higher your hands are the easier the push up is. Start as high as you need to and bring them lower as you get stronger.

12801,"NO. PLEASE DON'T DO THAT
 You should be in calorie deficit (i.e. burning more than you eat) but burning off all your calories is incredibly unhealthy. For a start your body needs calories literally to stay alive- it's called your basal metabolic rate (bmr) so breathing, heart pumping, standing up is using calories etc. 

 and if you're only eating 600-1000 kcal a day, that sounds really unhealthy. You will almost certainly be deficient in nutrients and it isn't sustainable long term.  So not only is it unhealthy, you'll probably gain the weight back when you've finished 

And that's even if you lost weight. Eating way below your calori needs will signal to your body thajt your body needs to go into starvation mode and so will look to hold onto fat so it will be harder to lose weight.

Aim for 1-2 lb a week weigh loss that is healthy and is more likely to be far more sustainable which means hopefully you can maintain a healthy weight long yerm.
A lb of fat is about 3500 kcal so if you eat 500 kcal less a day than you need, you will lose a 1 lb a week",0

Breaking down muscle is much slower of a process than reducing fat. So just stay consistent and good luck!,0

I admire the courage to ask the question. It all depends on the person.

Likewise, I’ve heard people feel rejuvenated after having “done the deed” and then they feel better to workout afterwards. It all depends on the person. Personally, I feel stronger when I don’t do engage in the activity for a while. So just see what happens.

If you’re mainly dealing with leg fat the solution it reduce your calories and focus on reducing your body fat. There’s no way to target any one area of fat/muscle in the body. Running is a good way to burn calories to get yourself into a calorie deficit. But I would focus as well on your nutrition and see if that get you anywhere. And if you do have too much extra muscle avoid doing any exercises that would cause to much muscle growth i.e. squats, lunges, deadlifts, etc. Running will strengthen you legs but with a calorie deficit you will begin to lose weight in many areas where you’re carrying extra weight.

12834,"If you have never run before, try to ease into it. If you run every single day you will 1. Burn out very quickly and 2. Possibly injure yourself. You need to let your leg muscles build up so that you protect your bones and joints from wear and tear. Stronger muscles will help prevent injuries. Calf raises, squats and lunges are the easiest body weight exercises to help build those muscles for running.  Definitely have some kind of activity (going for a walk, yoga, stretching, Pilates, etc) on your rest days, but focus on giving enough time for muscle groups to recover. So if you worked abs and arms the day before, consider working legs the next day. If that makes sense. There are so many methods out there to organize work and rest days, but do what feels good to you.

Also try to change up what type of running you are doing. Don’t run a mile every day. You’ll get very good at running a mile and not too much else ;) Aim for one speed day a week where you develop your speed and also your heart rate/breathing by working intensely for an interval of time or distance and then walking or resting for an interval. Lots of fun speed workouts out there. 30/60s, pyramid drills, just sprinting for distance, etc (give it a google). I like speed days because it keeps your mind busy. Also consider incorporating a comfortable mid distance run once a week where you are just running for a distance that makes you feel good. The third kind of run you should try planning is a “long distance” run. Usually this is your stretching and growing type of run. Either running farther than you usually can or by setting an amount of time. If you can run comfortably for 15 minutes than try running for 25 minutes, if you usually go two laps around the block, go three. This run is going to be slower and harder, but it helps you work up to farther and faster runs.

Also *gets on soapbox* get good running shoes!!! And don’t wear them for anything but running. Building muscles in your legs will help avoid injuries, but the proper footwear is vital to cushion joints and such, especially when running on concrete or asphalt. Please please please sink some money into good shoes so that you don’t get hurt. Not worth it (coming from someone who worked too much, too soon, in the wrong shoes and developed stress fractures). *steps off soapbox*

Most importantly, just keep at it!! And welcome to the running club! :))",0
12835,I guess that's is true.,0
12836,I'm so proud of you!!! You're doing great! Keep up the good work!!!,0
12837,"Thank you so much! I couldn’t agree more, it took me so long to just ignore my depression long enough to hop out of bed and step outside!",0
12838,"Great Job! Over-coming that voice in your head is the hardest part.

Consistency is key, but just as important as consistency is being patient and setting realistic goals. We can all get down on ourselves when we don't see results right away or plateau; don't be discouraged, this is normal and that is why it's best to base your progress on how your progress in your training and how you feel.

Listen your body, some days you WILL need that extra rest and there's no shame in adjusting your program to account for that rest.",0

12840,"Hey well done. The mental hurdle of getting out there and doing it is the hardest part. Once you get going you’ll realise how much better you feel physically and mentally. One bit of advice is to start looking at your diet and see what small improvements you can make, such as cutting back on sugar, drinking more water and ensuring you have a varied diet.",0
12841,"That is great advice, thank you! Will one rest day be enough? On rest days can I do any workouts?",0
12842,"Yes girl!!! Keep up the hard work. My advice would be to go ahead and schedule the all important rest days, those days that you do get to stay in bed and give your muscles a chance to rebuild. If you know that on whateverday you get to stay in bed, you’ll be more likely to get up every other day. So proud! The hardest part is just doing it, get a good rhythm going and you’ll be feeling stronger and faster in no time!!",0

12855,I'd do weight loss first otherwise you won't see your gains bro.,0
12856,Then go watch Gravity Transformation on yt. Its free content and well explained.,0
12857,Since I have only a little chub my main goal would be muscle build.,0
12858,"For a beginner, what type of exercises are advised for the full body?",0
12859,No prob :),0
12860,"Depends on how you workout. If you want to burn fat train everyday. If you are looking to build muscle than workout each muscle group 2 times a week. But take a rest of 48 hours between each muscle group. 
I do not recommend bro split instead go for a full body workout but remember to switch your workout plans each month. Do compound lifts as often as possible ( squats, dead lifts, bench press..) 
And I cant stress this enough but diet is 50% of work. 
Also I recommend AthelanX and Gravity Transformation for education.",0
12861,Start by doing at least 3 times per week and work your way up.  There is really no limit. I have had clients that have never trained and started off with 5 days a week and were able to complete their programs.,0
12862,Thanks I'll look them up!,0
12863,Lower body is definitely where i notice the most difficultiws but I dont think I want to get too focussed on one section particularly.,0
12865,"If your ultimate goal is to be able to do longer runs, the best way to get there is to do shorter runs and build up your work capacity. There is a exercise principle which states that training for the specific activity will ultimately help you perform better at that activity (not that this concept doesn't sound like common sense, but I digress.) Ultimately, if you work to build your cardio through biking and burpees, you will still feel a higher level of difficulty with long runs compared to building your running base to start doing longer runs. Trail runs are more exciting than just regular runs if you are needing something to be a bit more engaging as you have to be able to navigate through trails and plan foot placement on varying levels of surface and incline. The big question to ask is why you want to have better cardio? Is it for heart health? Is it to run longer distances? Is it for weight loss? Your goals will best help identify what types of activities you will enjoy doing consistently over and over again.",0
12866,"i'll try it, thank you",0
12867,"I’m loving the programs by GMB Fitness. It seems a bit pricy for their full bundle, but you get lifetime access (instead of a subscription) and they let you pay in installments. It came up when I was looking for a replacement for a gym I loved but couldn’t afford.",0
12868,"What kind of body parts are you looking at? Or whole body? 

For me I found a lot of YouTube vids on ankle,knees,hips, which have been a weak point for me, I'm sure whatever you are looking for will be on YouTube",0
12869,More for use as a rehab tool. Not a supplement to loading with weights.,0
12870,"As somebody with a similar problem, I worked with planking (for core strength) and I lifted weights. However, I used my bed for incline press ups (pushups right) and gradually I worked my way to the ground completely. It’s all about knowing your body and training it. Hope that helps",0
12872,"Have you tried incline press ups? Can start using your countertop (as long as it is sturdy) and work your way down to the ground. Progress from countertop to chair, from chair to stool, from stool to ground. Does that help?",0
12873,"You can hit triceps with chair dips, which will help your press ups.  Also, try pressups from your knees, as slow as you can handle with the greatest range of motion you can manage.",0
12874,"unfortunately not, i can fill bags with books or old tech or something to use though",0
12875,"Press ups are more of a chest exercise.  

Do you have any dumbbells?",0
12876,Fork putdowns,0
12877,"If you’re just beginning strength training, I would start with 2-3 full body routines a week. You’ll want to prioritize compound movements like shoulder presses, chest presses, and rows for upper body and squats, lunges, and deadlifts for lower body. Maybe start with 3 sets of 10-12 reps of each. You’ll want to pick a weight that is challenging and about two reps short of failure. It takes a while to figure out the right weight for the rep range so don’t be afraid to increase the weight if the lifts aren’t challenging enough! You can also include isolation movements, like bicep curls and tricep extensions for example, however you’ll typically want to do those after the compound movements.",0

12879,They work but I don't think they provide much more benfit than standard weight training. Much better for a rehab and injury recovery tool to increase strength when using weight is contraindicated.,0

12894,"Having anxiety in the past I had the same problem and did my first run today. I tend to go extremely red even before I sweat as well which always made me nervous. I did delay leaving the house for half an hour but I just thought of it as something that had to be done, so I had no choice. 

No one was looking, no one really cared that I was out for a run. And if I did feel someone was looking my way - or if a car went past - I would just tell myself “who cares, they won’t see me again anyway”.",0

12897,"To be honest, it took a while for me to really get into mobility work. That was until I injured my rotator cuff, which forced me to do rehab and mobility exercises and very mild strength work.

It’s about finding that balance between strength training and allowing your body to un-tense itself which avoids injury. Mobility exercises might not be the most exciting but paying to see a sports therapist and physio isn’t either.",0

12901,"Walking and biking are great low impact ways to building up your muscular endurance. Biking will burn more calories than walking provided it’s more intense than a casual stroll.

Burpees are more of an explosive exercise which would be hard to repeat and on the body several days in a row especially on someone newer to exercise. Body weight exercises like push ups, squats, lunges are good for improving muscular strength. Depending on what equipment you have at your disposal you could do lateral shoulder raises (raising your arms to the side), bicep curls, over head press, over head tricep extensions, pull ups, Supermans, bent over rows, calve raises, bridges, etc.",0

12939,You look so familiar for some reason.,0
12940,"I totally relate to this. I’m also 22 and I’ve never gone through anything like you have but I’ve always been a little on the sedentary side. I didn’t play sports or anything in high school and when I got to college I got really worried about gaining the freshman 15. I met some great friends and we tried going to the on-campus workout classes and I think that’s where I really got comfortable working out and knowing how/what to do. I’m still figuring it out and I still have a hard time being active regularly. I know most people don’t have access to classes or something but I think the social aspect can make it really fun! If you have any good friends you feel comfortable with maybe see if they would like to join you. My roommate and I have been going on long walks with weighted backpacks during quarantine since we can’t go to the gym. I also recently got into rock climbing and I find that I can spend hours there and get a really great workout. Basically what I’m drowning on about here is that it always helps to try new things and get creative with how you want to be active. Friends always help but podcasts on a lone hike or your favorite tunes during a workout are great too. Just go at your own pace and do your best not to compare yourself to others. I wish you the best!
*also* I like to keep small amounts of shitty food around my apartment so that I can eat that when I really crave it instead of going to get fast food.",0
12941,"I lifted pretty seriously for ten years, and recently it’s been catching up to me.  I liked being bulky and walking around heavy and having brute strength.  But the process of lifting I didn’t know how to manage and often got paralysis by analysis, or just chased numbers.  I frequently went overboard where I should’ve cut workouts short, etc. and honestly a lot of the time I lifted was out of a need to vent anger.  I was doing this on top of imbalances I’ve had since childhood.  It’s landed me in PT for 3-4 things this past 6 months and what I’ve realized is that I feel SO much better doing the light PT work for my joints and mobility.  So I’d suggest maybe just stretches and routines for improving lumbar/thoracic/cervical mobility.  Posture work is big too.  You leave a workout without breaking too hard of a sweat and your body actually feels better, not beaten down.  Just something to consider.",0
12942,Prepare to spend a lot of time and money on diet.,0
12943,Can you go to physio now? That’s my tip. You need professional help with your back and a physio can help you reduce pain and strength muscles so working out isn’t so awful.,0

12945,Resistance bands. I started when I was over 50. Easy on the joints. Safe. Either get loop bands like rubberbanditz or tube bands like Bodylastics. You might have to get off brand things right now because everything is getting sold out. If you stick with it get these brands to replace them. They are the safest and the best made. Use google and YouTube to find good workouts using them. Plenty. Good luck.,0

12978,"Losing weight primarily happens in the kitchen, not the gym, so make sure you’re on point there first. 

To incorporate more exercise, start with just going for regular walks. You could also try something low impact like swimming, rowing, or an elliptical. If you’re really interested in running, maybe start with something like a couch to 5k program. As you’re starting out, it’s more about adapting your body to the time performing rather than the distance.

12983,"Hey Fenix,

I've been there, my thoughts are with you.  I was in a similar position, with any exercise meaning I'd be in real pain for days afterwards.  I found that pilates helped me - it took a few months of once a week sessions to feel real benefits, but they were huge once they started.  Walking too - it's not going to give you the calorie burn like some other forms of exercise, but will help more than you realise at first.  You can do both of these more easily as often as your body will let you, and walking is easy to fit into your daily schedule.  I really hope it helps, and good on you for deciding to do something, that can be the hardest step.",0

If I were to offer you one exercise that would make your lower back super strong would you do it? If so do planks. 
I will just leave out the part that it trains your body to lose the flexibility it should have and then the one day your back pulls a muscle your back will become 5 times stiffer than normal leading to back problems that take 20 times longer to heal because you improperly conditioned your body to lock up its muscles/joints instead of strength and mobility training.

Those are 15lbs dumbbells. I was doing my last set (closed-grip push up to oblique knee tuck) of complete body workout routine. It's one of fav exercises. It's great movement for training tricep and abs. I've started off with basic push-up as a beginner, it was freakin hard due to my weak arms lol. As I've been spending more time to training in the gym, I find that it's effortless for me do do push-up on dumbbells. Are you good at pushing up?",0

13067,"Think of the variance in long workouts, sprints etc.

For example do your morning workout 2 times through as fast as possible 


Another day
Send a timer and do as many burpees as you can do in 7 mins or do 100 as fast as possible with minimal rest

Another day do a chipper style workout
100 air squats
90 sit-ups
80 lunges
70 burpee
60second plank
50 mountain climbers
40 pushups
30 chair dips
20 jump squats
10 hand release pushups


Variance of time, intensity and loading will keep your body guessing. Also dont forget to take rest days, they are just as important so your body can recover.

For this workout I did Flys 4 x 10-12 then the holds to superset.  :30 rest between sets. Give it a shot and have fun!",0

13074,"Looks like a good start, but if you are looking to lose weight you also might want to create a variance of what you do. Your body will get used to this workout.

So maybe creat a workout that you change every few days . Reps, rounds of reps level of intensity. For example take out the water breaks and just push through the workout. You could also add going through one of those workouts 2-3 times. Thats going to create muscle endurance and being able to train while under fatigue. This will speed up metabolic rates.

1) Run at night or early in the morning when there are less people. 
2) Come to the realization that 95% of people are too wrapped up in their internal monologue to care what you are doing. Going on a run is nothing new and if you see someone, chances are you will run past them before either of you get to really react.",0

13088,thanks for the advice,0
13089,"What do you have available to you equipment wise?

Without equipment, the best recommendation is to develop a push up protein scheme. Start with doing normal pushups. I like doing EMOM (every minute on the minute). 

Set an alarm for 10 rounds of 60 seconds. At the top of every minute, do 10 pushups. Repeat for 10 minutes. Next session, try going for 12 rounds. Then 15 rounds. Once you get to 15 rounds, try increasing the reps from 10 to 12 reps. 

Or you can mix in different pushup variants. Close grip, diamond, mountain, 1 and 1/2 reps, archer, Spiderman etc (you can Google lists of pushup variations online). Find a list of 5-8 variants and do 3 sets of 10 reps of each. Then next time, do 3 sets of 11 reps. Or add an additional variant.

If you have a weight vest, use it.. If not, load a backpack with books and try that (maybe it'll be too awkward?).

The key here is that you want to track what you're doing so you know how to adjust each workout. You want to do progressive overload so that each workout is harder and the stimuli is more and more each and every session.",0

I’ve suffered from ptsd and you have to find something to help you relax and deal with the anxiety. I listen to meditations on a free app called insight timer and I take slow deep breaths to calm myself. I exercise every day as it make me feel good. So to be blunt- no one is going to do this for you. You have to find the strength to take that first step, that first step being try some online workouts - there are millions on YouTube. You might do 10 minutes, that’s fine but every day you’ll get stronger and fitter if you stick at it and you will feel good.

-You can jog on spot in ur home,or go to a park nearby and do brisk walking or slow jogging,it will be really helpful for your heart.

-Standing exercises like jumping jacks, squat jumps and even running the stairs is a good form of cardio.

-Jumping rope will also be helpful.

-You can try swimming too,if u have a pool available.

Remember all forms of cardio will help u strengthen ur heart and make it healthy,but the food also has a major impact on the health of your heart

13148,"Hey!
First of all, its never too late to start off with anything at any age. I read ur question and the first thought which struck me was that, you should start taking baby steps first. What i mean is that, start by doing small things, it could be anything which can make u feel better.
I'll give u some examples, whenever u feel too lazy and feel depressed, start playing some music preferably loud and try singing along with the song.
Staying in bed for a prolonged hours will make u feel depressed,that too everyday. Try waking up a bit early than u do, like 7-8 in the morning or something like that,take a stroll outside, make it a habit. Try contacting some of your friends whom u haven't been in contact for a while, talk to them, if possible meet them, try going out with them and if not that, then u can go somewhere outside like a park or just some marketplace on your own too.
If u like keeping pets, u can try to keep a dog or a cat, they lift up ur spirits at times when u feel low, and not to mention that they entertain a lot.
Try to start exercising, even if u dont want to loose weight, exercising is a great mood lifter, u can try doing light exercises, it could be stretching or anything like that, you can try yoga as well,there are a lot of tutorials on the web.
ALSO KEEP DRINKING LOTS OF WATER !
You can also try practising some of your hobbies.
These are some tips as to how u can elevate ur mood when u feel low,but the most important thing to realise is that, the past should be kept in the past, whatever happened with you, didnt happen because of you, its the person you were with, who is to be blamed...
You know better what u deserve and I believe that since you posted your question, it itself is an indication that u have the will to change urself, to change your lifestyle for the better...
To believe in yourself is the most important thing right now, to believe that you can overcome this phase, to believe that you can make urself feel better,to believe that you can change your habits and transform yourself into someone who will be totally different from the person you were a few years back...
Try writing all the new things you start doing from now onwards, write it during the time you go to bed at night,so that before sleeping,u remind yourself that you did new things today. For the coming days,do this regularly,and at the end of every week go through all the new things u wrote.
Plant a seed in your mind, the idea that your life can be different from what it was, keep doing these new things everyday and after a few weeks you will see that seed grow into a sapling, that is THE NEW YOU.",0

One of my favorites is their 30 minute fat burn video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC\_L9qAHVJ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC_L9qAHVJ8)) It's also great that you are walking, if you aren't ready to run try putting some pep in your step and speed walk almost and move your arms. Listen to some upbeat music to keep you on the same speed and to make it more fun too! I also wouldn't start working out EVERY single day - try easing into it with 3 or 4 times a week while also adjusting your diet to let your body adapt to these new changes",0

13165,"Are We Having Fun Yet? Stress and Exercise
Like taxes, stress is a part of everyone’s life.  The “experts” tell us that some stress is good because without it there would be no motivation to do anything!  However, if you are like me, serious stress and anxiety makes me feel bad physically – I am unable to eat. This can’t be good! 

For most of us, stress is low-level most of the time.  Our daily tasks and relationships give us a bit of stress but not major anxiety.  The body’s response to low-level stressors is designed to motivate us to action with a slightly raised heart rate and increased mental clarity –similar to the response to caffeine. 

In times where stress levels go higher, the responses are what many people call the “fight or flight” response.  The body sends blood to the extremities to get ready for action!   These responses are normal and good for you – except when the stress levels remain high for a long time.  When the body perpetually stays in a stressed state, the systems begin to break down.  Think of it like a car engine where the throttle is stuck and the engine is constantly “revved up”.  Not only will it consume A LOT of gasoline, but the mechanical parts will wear out faster.

13174,I loved it too !  Never had that much fun working out in a while haha !,0
13175,"Here’s my free, honest advice . You can’t spot train your upper body to make it look toner .  So doing upper body workouts all day is not going to help you.  You need to do total body HIIT workouts that boost your metabolism and burn fat fast ! As for your diet ,  you want to stay between a minimum 100 calorie deficit and a maximum of 500 calorie deficit from your BMR per day.  Rest , and don’t stress is the most important .",0
13176,"Want the Short answer ? stop doing so much cardio . Lift more weights .  And eat real food , not shakes .",0
13177,Very creative!,0
13178,Squats,0
13179,I love it hahahaha,0
13180,Agree on your point here. Changing the position can work different areas and even swap between pronated and supinated grips as well.,0
13181,"Take a look at r/homegym.  Tons of posts and people knowledgeable about assault bikes.  It’s probably one of the more popular pieces of equipment, next to a C2 rower.",0
13182,Pull-ups!,0

13184,"Yep definitely looked at the rogue but my GF wants to use it too and the echo is too big for her! 
I have only used the assault and was able to do moderate cardio on that for 1/2 hour or so as well as HIIT but worried about the maintenance with a chain. Schwinn seems more durable with the belt drive but not sure if the belt would be harder to do a low-moderate intensity workouts.",0
13185,"Veey hard to do both at the same time.  Losing weight comes from eating at a calorie deficit. I would do that while you workout withh pushups, dips ,rows to start building a little muscle.",0
13186,100% agreed! Same like with cables. You got to keep that muscle under tension during whole movement. Thanks for your input!,0
13187,"Haha, you're not you when you're hungry! (for information)",0
13188,"You don’t necessarily need protein powder .  I haven’t used protein powder in years and I been able to maintain my physique .  Use it only for convenience when you’re not getting enough protein in your diet .  You should have a minimum of 20% of protein in your diet . As for gaining some weight (muscle ) ,  you need to be at a calorie surplus .  I recommend at least going 200 or 300 calories above your BMR .  So you have to eat a little more than you usually eat.  Even more so now that you are going to be training consistently which will burn a lot of calories .",0
13189,Your body is really just a thermodynamical system.,0

13193,thanks for the info.,0
13196,"Yeah resistance bands are a great tool for recruiting muscle fibers !  You can do chest presses and chest flys for the chest .  And tricep pull downs or tricep overhead extensions with them .  You can do shoulder press and lateral shoulder flys with them .  Then bicep curls to get the bicep .  The only disadvantage with resistance bands  is that there isn’t constant tension throughout the rep.  So you want to hold the contraction where the band is at its maximum tension .  I also recommend incorporating calisthenics into your routine ; doing push-ups and various push-up variations like pike pushups , will help you develop chest and shoulder strength as well as increase muscle growth even More so than just using resistance bands .  Let me know if you have any more questions .  I would be glad to help .",0
13197,"Consider getting a heart rate monitor like a wahoo tickr. Use myfitness pal to check your calories. People usually are pretty surprised by how little calories they actually burn exercising and then thinking they have more need to eat more. And really, you look pretty great so if you are wanting to step up try getting into more strength workouts. Those make more muscle, burn more calories and might give you the results you are after more quickly.

The other thing you could discover is that you aren’t actually eating enough. Too little calories and you body goes into protection mode. So it takes awhile to figure this part out and everyone is different. Good luck!",0

13199,"Be ready to work and be consistent. On days when you are wondering if you can do it, do it anyway. No more excuses. Personal accountability. Start caring for and concentrating on yourself. Shoot for 30 days. If you make that, shoot for 30 more. If you make that then it will be a habit.",0
13200,Maybe go onto YouTube and search for full body dumbbell workouts. Or dumbbell workouts. Tons of good ones. Do the ones where they go thru the whole workout with you. Sites like fitness blender might also be good for you.,0
13201,Yes. But don’t do what this fella is doing here. Make sure you have tension in the bands even at the start of the motion. Otherwise it’s pretty useless. And with bands go to failure. I’ve used bands for 10 years. Love them.  It you take advantage of their advantages they are outstanding.,0

13211,"Hey just a recommendation: if you move your feet towards the bar a bit so that when you pull in, the bar is right below nipple line u will activate lats and mid trap/rhomboids a little better. In the position you are doing right now there is a lot of posterior delt activation (not a bad thing b/c that IS important) but for a progression to pull ups it is good to activate lats so that when you do eventually transition, you are not relying too much on posterior delt.",0
13212,"Locking out your arms is safe. Have a look at gymnasts and calisthenics atheletes who hold static movements like planche, iron cross, levers as well as dynamics like pull-up and push-ups. All of them to full lockout.

It allows for full range of motion (ROM), building strength in those key areas. By ‘half-repping’ like pull-up with bent elbows limits mobility thus losing movement range which could result to injury later on",0
13213,"Some people struggle to do strict pull-ups which may lead to doing the exercise incorrectly (e.g. no full range of motion, using momentum to pull up, not activating scapula, etc). Beginners who are new to building upper body strength might not be able to do a full pull-up so will need progressions to build up to it.",0
13214,Also looking for one. None of the door frames in my ancient apartment can handle the pull up bar I have,0

13216,"If your a complete beginner you want to concentrate on compound lifts initially for the first few months. So compound movements are movements that involve several muscles. Like deadlift, squat and military press. If you're gonna train without guidance it best to go on YouTube and see the correct technique. I like to train high volume. But as a beginner you wouldn't recover from a volume routine. As for what workout is best it's tricky because what works for one probably isn't gonna work for another. So I personally think a routine should always start with a compound movement as you'll be at your strongest.",0

I personally love Chloe Ting on Youtube and she has multiple lower ab workouts that are only 10 minutes each, really easy to add to your daily routine. To lose fat overall, cardio is going to be your best friend. I’ve been walking outside, staying inside and doing jumping jacks and jumping squats, etc. Have you considered enhancing your diet too?",0
13234,You can spot reduce from specific problem areas. What you need to do to lose fat is be in a calorie deficit. Usually I would recommend a good training split in the gym focusing mainly on strength. By now seeing as we're all inside. Doing HIIT circuits( high intensity interval training) would be the best place to start. Your body adapts quickly so start nice and easy and as you feel yourself get better at the exercises increase the time you train and also the reps. Hope this makes sense,0
13235,Why would you regress?,0

I recommend if your budget allows to purchase a concept 2 rower or versaclimber. 

Also to build muscles you will need to incorporate more fat/protein. After an honest workout, a scoop of whey and grass fed whole milk is my fav (a few hours before bed). It prevents hunger and repairs muscles.",0

13253,"Find out your body’s caloric requirements at maintenance and than reduce the amount of calories from there (your reduction of calories would be based on how far away the wedding is ex 100-350cal deficit). eat a balanced diet of carbohydrates, protein, and fats.

Introduce an exercise program into your weekly routine. You mentioned that your wrists are weak so i listed exercises you can do for the body parts you mentioned that have less impact on the wrists.

ARMS: bicep curls, hammer curls, (skull crushers with dumbells in a neutral grip) 

Shoulders: side lateral raises (dumbell), rear deltoid flys (dumbell) front raises, upright rows

All these exercises should tighten up those areas you’ve shown(along with proper diet plus nutrition). Don’t listen to the common misconception that women shouldn’t use resistance training in their routines. 99% of the examples you see where women have really muscular physiques to the point where they resemble fit men are using synthetic male hormones at high levels.

the only time i successfully lost any weight I was eating 1000 to 1200 calories a day, and that shit is just impossible for me. I get insanely ravenous. The only time it worked before is because I was on keto Plus taking a trans-resveratrol supplement made from Japanese knotweed but it made me nearly manic. I'd already lost 20lbs from being keto for a year and plateaued. It was mostly just water weight though which came back when I quit keto. The transresveratrol gave me really bad panic attacks but insane amount of energy and never hungry. absolutely no way I can take it again though. It was way too disruptive and gave me terrible insomnia and anxiety. I wish I could take it again, maybe a lower dose because it worked so well at curbing appetite and I lost 20lbs in 3 months (fast for me) but the insomnia and near-mania were unbearable.

13275,"I don't how myfitnesspal calculates the calories, so I'm not sure how if that's a too much deficit or not. However, you should not eat the calories back if you want lose weight, but if you want to maintain you should eat at your maintenance calories level.
 The amount of protein as well depends level of activities, age, body type, ... to get the exact amount. But if we want to go general 1-1.2 grams per kilogram body weight should be good. And you want to distribute that amount throughout your day and have a dose of protein evey 3 to 4 hours. Protein would be the important one because you want to make sure you're getting enough to prevent muscle loss. You need all the macros.

13279,"Hey legendarylana! I hate to disagree but their previous statement is incorrect about dropping this exercises. Cardio, though helpful to burn calories at a higher rate for a short period of time is useful it is not going to get the results you posted about. Lifting weights won’t get you huge and beefy, it will actually help you refine the muscles and time them up. You improve the muscles so your body burns calories at a higher rate even at rest but burn longer post workout as well.   I would say try doing what is called drop sets. Start at a higher weight for a certain amount of reps then drop the weight and attempt the same amount of reps. That style helps you create lean muscles. If it was push-up’s I do strict then when I fail I go to my knees or put hands on a bench to do it again. 
Hope that helps!",0
13283,That’s a great idea actually thank you! I will have to wait until the covid restrictions are over here in Australia but once they are I’ll give it a go!,0
13284,"Key points:

• While pull-ups is upper body dominant, it still requires activation of your glutes and legs (ideally with ankles touching). This keeps the form strict and prevents the lower half of the body being ‘dead weight’, thus making the pull-up ‘easier’. See here on how it is done: 

https://youtu.be/FnWrvWZDJTo

• Begin with arms locked out and finish the same way you started. Keep the line of your body straight

• Activating the scapula - these would be your shoulder blades. There are plenty of exercises here on how to work, strengthen and condition the scapula, which will be really helpful in other exercises including push-ups, handstands, weightlifting etc. See here on exercises on what exercises you can do: https://youtu.be/HyQw68TSMoA

• Take your time! It’s about the journey rather than how long it will take to achieve it. Digest the movement in small steps so you can do it properly to avoid injury plus gain the knowledge on how to have better control of your body

The pull-up, same with push-ups, is a transferable skill that feeds into many other exercises. Build the foundation correctly and it will pay off in the long run.

Give it a go and as always, stay safe.",0

13287,Not sure if you can swim but I'd recommend that or at least treading water. I used to play water polo in HS and back then the backs of my arms were lean. Maybe try treading water with just your arms for small durations. I'm not really sure as to a work out routine for that but I do know swimming/water exercise is zero impact so your wrists should fare better.,0

13308,"Depends on many factors, main ones being diet and type of exercise. I’ve been lifting for about a year and a half and just started noticing visible growth around the 6 month mark. But that took a lot of trial and error learning which exercises activated my glutes the most and which I could really implement progressive overload on and focus on strength. Because with strength, come the gains. I personally love barbell back squats and barbell hip thrusts for going heavy and they give me the biggest pump. Deadlifts and their variations are great too. My advice is focus on heavy compound and support with lighter isolation movements (cable kickbacks, glue bridges, etc) and you’ll be on your way. 

Oh, diet also! Make sure you are eating enough and of the right things. To grow, you ideally want to be in a slight surplus. You can recomp depending on your starting point but at a certain point your body needs the extra calories to grow muscle. Don’t be afraid of food! Just be mindful of what you’re putting into your body and make sure your protein is high! Good luck!",0

13310,"Thank you for this great advice. Sadly, I found out that not eating enough caused my body to store more fat as you mentioned. The thing is I hate cardio so much, I only do Peleton for 30 minutes and it’s killing me every minute. Should I force myself to do 1 hour? I just hate that my body is so weak. I tried to do work out exercise on youtube, and those, oh man, are killers.",0
13311,"Hi there! Love to give you some advice:

Many accounts have already stated it, but the the best body change happens through nutrition and a combination of resistance (weight) training/cardio. Ideally you want to look at the following:

Nutrition: best results for body transformation or weight loss is to increase protein and stick with complex carbs (brown rice, whole grain bread, fruit) and vegetables. Sadly one meal a day and smoothies will not give your body what it needs to sustain adequate blood sugar; if your blood sugar goes bottoms up, then your body can likely store what you eat as fat in the assumption that you are starving. Try to pack in 3 meals a day with a fibrous snack in between each meal. Also, avoid calorie counting; although caloric deficit is the best way to lose weight, your goal should not be weight loss! Your goal should be strength training to “tone” up, which moves into my next point.

Exercise: the most ideal situation for a weekly exercise routine is 3 days of weight training, 2 days of cardio, 1 day of active recovery (yoga, Pilates, foam rolling, etc). This weekly routine is edited in relation to the goal of the individual. The weight training can be anything from body weight exercises, to light dumbbells, to heavy barbell work. Don’t assume that lifting some weights will make you grossly big like a man, that is likely not to happen unless you train to look like that. On cardio days think low intensity. Our body’s main fuel source during lower heart rate zones is fat. There is a point for high intensity heart rate training, but that should not be a daily thing. The 1 day of recovery is to make sure that you are practicing mobility, stability, and giving your body time to rest. 

Finally, if you are using an Inbody or BIA machine, don’t believe it. There are quite a few protocols to follow before measurements (ie no eating 4 hours before testing, take the test before working out, etc) in order to get “decent” results. Lots of times it’s just a number to go off of. I’m 4 foot, 11.5 inches at 130lbs (CrossFit athlete) and that machine tells me I’m close to obesity every time (I’m not, I promise). Hope this helps!",0

I use dumbbells, barbells, and some machines at the gyms. Now I’m just at home doing similar workouts with free weights.",0
13320,"You mention in comments you want to be more tone. In order to do this, you have to do more weightlifting specific exercises. The 30min if cardio is good. 


I would recommend a combination of 30m cardio plus 30m weights. One day do 1 hour cardio. Next day do 1 hour weight training. You can YouTube plenty of at home High intensity interval training classes. Using something like your laundry soap as a dumbell. 

Or it can be really simple as 

10x pushups at 3 sets
10x squats at 3 sets
10x sit-ups

At the end of day, if you want to be tone you need muscle. If you want muscle, you need to do exercises that build muscle. The best way to do this is to constantly trick your body with your workout. Never the same thing 5x week. It would always be some form of change bc muscles are smart but you can outsmart them",0

Then I started lean bulking (worked up to 2000 kcals a day aka three meals at least). I did very little cardio and focused on weights. I did that for 3 months and got back to 109lbs.

Now I’m doing a proper cut (calorie deficit) with weights + mild cardio (walking) and I’m at 105 lbs and still dropping. I’m 5’1 and my body fat started at 30% now it’s at 25%. Source - inbody scan

I'm assuming you're stuck at home, so check out r/bodyweightfitness especially the FAQ &amp; Wiki. The Daily Help Thread is very active, so don't hesitate to ask for any help if nothing in the sidebar makes sense.

Protein shakes aren't anything special. They're just another mix of calories &amp; macronutrients. See how much you're eating, and how they compare with your TDEE (you can look up TDEE calculators to give you a rough estimate)

Lastly, don't underestimate stress! (and it's def a stressful time for a lot of people) It makes it easier for our bodies to hold on to fat. But this doesn't mean to eat even less, it means to do what you can to reduce your stress levels.",0

I would calories count for 2 weeks this will give you a clear indication.

You can think of it in another way, which would only further put you at ease. If you play any form of sport, particularly something that involves a lot of running and/or jumping, you’re essentially doing cardio during the entire activity, and depending on the sport you’re almost certainly putting more force through your bones than you would squatting. If people can do that without it impacting their height, you absolutely can squat or do cardio without a problem.",0

2. Make sure to really work you core all around. Upper, lower, oblique, and all at once (plank, v-ups, mountain climber variations, etc)
3. Try working the explosiveness off all those exercises (slow down, pause, explode up!) this will hello when gyms reopen and you can lift weight again but you will have still worked strength by going slow on the downward motion but improve your power through the explosive contraction. 
Hope that helped a bit! Keep it up!",0
13415,"Hey Gem! So sadly toning in one are over another is something called spot reducing which is not possible. As you workout more and more and your muscles develop you will burn more calories naturally and when you workout so that is a huge plus! Arms tone up first usually but sadly midriff is last (but usually where you initially see the inches come off first). 
I would recommend going to bodybuilding.com (name is misleading, it is more a fitness website for all levels, and have workouts for beginners to advanced, plus a database ranking exercises by difficulty and location. 
Focus that technique over anything else. 
Try filling up a bag with a hook loop (like a school bag) and fill it up with books (easy to adjust weight by slipping a book in or out) these make great weights for arms. 
For your core just do body weight exercises but again focus that technique and try to get it perfect vs defaulting to what feels easier. Not many like core because it is difficult but it is the most beneficial.

13439,"I was in your shoes! I was a college athlete, graduated and gained about 50 lbs. These were the biggest things that helped me:

- stop focusing on the overall goal of “I need to lose 100 lbs”. Break it up into smaller goals/milestones like “this week I will be active 30 minutes a day and log my food, next week I will run a mile and not have soda, etc”. It took me forever to even start trying because I was too overwhelmed staring at this huge mountain of a task in front of me. You don’t have to start “big”, just start.

- have someone hold you accountable. This could be a friend, coworker, trainer, etc. I would bail on myself all the time (“I can sleep in today and skip my workout because I’m tired”) but if I was scheduled to run with someone I couldn’t leave them hanging! A support system of some form was really helpful for me, especially someone who could push me to keep going.

- be nice to yourself. I had a lot of confidence issues growing up and when I started gaining weight they all began to come back. I really struggled to like myself at all and would constantly be so angry at myself for eating that cookie/skipping that workout/etc. You’re going to have days when you don’t see the progress you want, or you say screw it and just eat ice cream for 3 days straight, or you go to the gym and just sit in the locker room for 20 minutes and leave (I’ve done that quite a few times). But each time that happens you still have the opportunity to start right back up again. You’re not going to suddenly start effortlessly working out 2 hours a day, eating only veggies and losing a pound a week, and that’s okay. You’re already making progress by asking how to start! Challenge yourself and be proud of yourself!

- take before pictures! Seriously. I was slowly losing weight but felt like I couldn’t see any difference. I took new pictures and put them side by side to my original pictures and practically fell on the floor. Wear the same clothes, be in the same location with the same lighting and all that stuff. You’ll be happy you did!

- find activities you enjoy, don’t just force yourself on a treadmill for hours if you hate it. You want things you can stick with and that you look forward to doing for years to come! 

- set up little rewards for yourself at certain milestones. One of mine was buying new workout clothes at 20 lbs lost. Stuff that makes you even more excited to lose weight and get healthy!

Okay I’ll shut up now lol. Good luck!!",0

13453,"You need to be in a caloric deficit and do some resistance training a few times a week combined with moderate sessions of cardio, both steady state and high intensity intervals. 

There is no secret, if you cannot do a particular workout at a certain intensity, your body is not ready for it. You need to go about this slowly and work your way up to it. 

Get your nutrition under control and the rest will come easy. That doesn’t mean going on any special diet like vegan or low carb or paleo or fasting or whatever. Just make sure if two things; you are in a caloric deficit, and you consume about 1.5g protein per kg of lean body mass. 

For exercising, just begin with what you know you can do and stay consistent, then ramp it up over time. Simple movements like walking and calisthenics is always a good start. Once you are lighter and have more of a solid base, then you can worry about going higher intensity.",0

13470,"So this is roughly what I did a few years back:

I started off walking 4mph on the treadmill for 30-40 minutes, 3 days/week. I did that for probably a month or even longer and then jumped to 5 days/week. After a month of that I was walking 6-7 days/week. This was over the course of January to May and I think I did a little elliptical in there. I also added incline of 2% on the treadmill. 

Once I was home for the summer I started jog/walking outside and gradually worked up to jogging the entire 3 mile course I had been doing. Ever since then I’ve been pretty consistent, but even after being really bad about working out for a few months I’m able to start off jogging right away and can work my tolerance back up quickly. 

I feel a lot better when I consistently work out. It gives me energy for the day when I do it in the morning. It also helps with losing weight which is a nice bonus.",0

As for at-home cardio workouts, getting outside for walks/jogs is probably your best bet. Otherwise you can jog in place, up and down stairs, etc. 

Maybe consider doing some body weight HIIT workouts instead of strict cardio— be mindful you’ll want to ease into resistance training if you’re worried about getting burnt out.",0

13487,"By having REALISTIC goals and time frames, for example losing 40 lbs in 2 months is not realistic, it's doable, but you'll feel bad and the chances of quiting and gaining all of it back is much higher. So you want to set realistic goals like losing that 40 lbs in a year. Then you want to break that down to smaller goals, like monthly and weekly goals, and then break it down to daily goals and keep track of them. Knowing that you achieved that small part that gets you closer to that big goal and those small doses of feeling of achievement, keeps you motivated. It's all in that small achievements. Whatever your goal is, break it down as small as you can, whether it gonna be running for 10 min on a day, or one extra rep by the end of the week and aim for that, DO IT and hold yourself accountable! It's okay if you do it and couldn't hit it, that's not failure, you're still closer than you were before, so be proud and know that it's gonna be easier to hit it next time. In addition to that build a support system for yourself. Get a coach (best option), talk to people in the gym, workout with a friend, share your achievements, join communities like this. Things like this gives you that little extra dose of motivation to keep going.",0
13488,I think if you get into a routine it can help. Like if you decide that at a certain time everyday you’ll exercise. There is also the discipline aspect. You need to decide you have to exercise at a certain point everyday. You don’t have to think about it as much if you already decided.,0

13498,"Hey! I appreciate you reaching out to the community like this, thanks.

I'm trying to lose weight (obviously while maintaining as much muscle as possible), and to do so I'm lifting 6x/week with one rest day (push/pull/legs x2), and I'm counting calories. I'm 5'9 165 lbs. My workouts usually go for an hour, and I lift hard with minimal breaks. Sometimes I throw on a 1.8 mile run, but recently I haven't.

I'm using MyFitnessPal (a general calorie counting app), and it gave me a calorie count of 2310 calories for a loss of 1 lb per week. If I do one of these training sessions, should I eat back the calories I burned? I ask because I'm trying to maintain muscle, and I fear that going under 2310 will put me at too much of a deficit.

On another note, with my regimen, how many grams of protein should I consume in a day to facilitate muscles *growth*?

Which macronutrients should I pay the most to when leaning out my body and why? Do individual ones have certain effects on the body?

But, if not and if you do not have a table, then try to find something you can use to do bent over rows with. 

Options for this might be a backpack full of heavy items, a couple of bug paint tins or heavy flower pot. You need something heavy enough to work the muscle in your back. Start 'thinking outside the box' and I'm sure you'll find something with some weight to it at home.

Bent over rows are going to be a lot easier than pull ups, so you will probably want to increase the number of reps.

Honestly, if getting better at pushups is your goal the trick is simply do more pushups (ie a routine, X# every morning, throughout day, etc). The more often you mix them into your routine, the better you’ll get at them. Same answer for other body weight exercises. Better pull-ups? Do more pull-ups.

To mix things up you could incorporate more triceps, back, shoulders, chest, etc exercises and those will help in the long run. Ultimately what you’ve described is normal and will improve with time if you keep at it. Just don’t overdo it and give yourself time for recovery too.",0

13536,"I think ya look fine. Most of the time all you can do is either lose a ton of weight or shift your focus. Your natural bodyweight covers muscle and bone structure which creates semi-unique shapes in all of us. You could strength train your obliques and create side muscles, which wont get rid of the love handles, but flatten out your sides and create the muscle look. Increasing the size of your front abdominals (and lower back) may tighten the skin and pull your sides in a bit. Ultimately, it might just be something to stop thinking about and if you keep working out, you may notice they aren't there one day. Or you can focus on losing a ton of body weight until even the toughest spots are worn away (although I think this approach is a bit radical). We all have our problem areas and it might be worth it to embrace them and dedicate yourself to consistent working out, preventing the problem from getting worse. Maybe solving it in the process. 

TLDR: I think consistent ab workouts (oblique focused) and not worrying about it. I've been doing athlean X youtube workouts for my own abs while on quarantine, which may help. Good luck",0

That's why even bikini/figure competitors have an off season actors/celebrities train for roles. Because eating at a level to achieve a certain aesthetic can be extremely mentally difficult.

Swivels for push ups to protect the wrists from overextension. Also dumbbells can be used to exercise rear, medial and anterior delts and you only need a 10lb &amp; maybe a 15-20lb set.

For quads unless you plan on buying a squat rack you're probably stuck with power intervals. Jumping lunges, regular lunges, 1 leg lunges, laying down hip extension (glutes).

As far as exercising, as long as you are burning more calories and eating less food (counting calories!!), you will lose weight. What exercises you do isn't as important. If your main concern is weightloss, just do a google search to see what exercises (cardio) burn the most calories per hour. Typically running or similar would probably be your answer.

1. Just a combo move putting together upright row to a shoulder press (moderate weight)
2. Thumbs Down Y’s: lean slightly forward (no more than 45 degrees or you change the muscle your working) your angle the thumbs down pinky up, and act like you are reaching a Y. So the arm positions in the movement is between a front raise and a lateral raise.
3. Regular lateral raises
4. Rotator Cuff Deltoid Rotations: this is a muscle transitional movement/Functional moving. Not letting the weight control the rotation speed.

2km in 45min described as a run is concerning. But if you didn’t get a fever until the next day they are likely unrelated. 

Having a sedentary lifestyle suggests a decreased immune system. Your body also is put under a lot of stress when you go from a very sedentary life to a more active one, which also temporarily puts you at a greater risk. Now depending on how much time had passed since the exercise, it’s possible that you were feeling some effects of fat burning as this increases body temp, body temp is also raised with the breakdown and reformation as you build stronger muscle. This however would typically be felt more so during exercises or possibly shortly after but within a few hours should be back to normal.

No it’s not going to turn you into a body builder unless your nutrition is exactly right and you’re lifting that way. It will however increase muscle giving that toned look. It’s also going to burn the fat that you have. 

However I think it’s important to note that women do need more fat than men to be considered healthy. Not only for child bearing (if that’s your think at any point in life) but also hormone balance.",0
13682,"After it becomes a habit, after a couple weeks (maybe a month for some people), you start to crave it. Your muscles literally *want* to exercise, and it's incredibly rewarding to satisfy that urge. Plus, the feeling i get after a work out is worth every second of effort.

The other thing i've found to be helpful, although it has become a cliche on reddit, is accepting and internalizing the difference between discpline and motivation. Motivation, while warm and fuzzy, is also fleeting and inconsistent. If you expect some sparking sense of motivation to get you through months of consistent workouts, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.

What helped me tremendously is removing the choice from the equation. Exercising, for me, is not optional. I have no choice. I must do it, no ifs ands or buts. When I don't give my mind an opportunity to come up with some excellent (read: bullshit) excuse not to work out, it starts finding ways to make the workout better rather than running from it. Don't give yourself a choice. Write it in your diary. I WILL exercise today, tomorrow, and for the next 3 months. I think you'll find that if you really employ the discipline strategy, you'll get to a point where just pushing play means you'll finish the workout. Much of what I struggled with was the mental buildup before a workout - how tired i'd be, how much i didn't want to do it, the soreness after, etc. etc. But as soon as I got 5 minutes into the workout, it was good as done. The other thing to remember is you don't have to go ALL OUT every single time. Do half speed. Half Reps. Half weight. Whatever it takes. Just fucking do it though.",0

13684,"So I would actually recommend doing it every BACK day. What the!?!? Yeah so doing it on arm day like you said you are working with jelly arms which means your secondary muscles that assist the main muscles during the press are already spent. Doing it on chest day you will find that the primary muscle is already taxed (though it is a great way to improve muscular endurance by doing push ups between chest exercise sets. But doing it on back day means two things:
1. You are working the opposite muscle group so those muscles will get warmed up with back work just out of having your chest stretch and be more ready and less taxed to do more reps. 
2. You get a full upper body work cause it will also hit shoulders and triceps.",0

13689,"It is all about creating habits, not willpower. Do you brush your teeth every day? Do a wall sit while you brush your teeth, or squats. I'm guessing you probably aren't able to go to a gym in times like these so just be more active. Think of it less as ""exercise"" and make it a habit of choosing activities or ways of doing something that require more activity. For exercise specifically, you'll have to make that time. Schedule it, tell a friend, daughter/son, parent, someone to keep you accountable maybe. Each person requires something different.

If you meant the actual exercises themselves. It will always be hard if you are pushing yourself to improve. Yes, stuff gets easier but you have to do harder exercises or more weight/faster or you will stagnate.

It's difficult now with the quarantine. You can ask your parents to buy meat and freeze it. I do that all the time. Also beans, brown rice, buckwheat, plain oatmeal,... It can all last for a year 😉
For breakfast, make overnight oats and add a nice handful of nuts and seeds or peanut butter, or coconut oil. Add cocoa powder, cinnamon, ginger or any spices you like. It's OK to add a teaspoon of honey, molasses or maple syrup. Alternatively make the same thing with buckwheat, barley. Or millet.. You can add frozen berries or dry fruit. 

And for lunch and dinner cook your frozen meat, fish, tofu or legumes and have it with vegetables ( fresh or frozen) or with your brown rice, quinoa or whole grain pasta. 

Eggs last quite a long time in the fridge. Canned fish are a great source of easy protein too 😊

Right now, we can't eat as many fresh vegetables and fruits as we would like. But we've got plenty of time to cook at home. And maybe you can use this time to practice your culinary skills 😉 There are plenty recipes on YouTube, Instagram, Fb, Pinterest... 

Just please make sure you don't fall into some crazy diet mindset. There are many people on the Internet who promote all kinds of craziness claiming there's ""science,"" behind it. It's very easy even for adults to be fooled and damage their health. Not only physical , but also mental. I know you won't like this, but you're still a growing child.

When I lay on my back and pick my legs slightly off the ground my core feels fine for a bit but then it gets too weak to keep my back entirely on the ground. Is it possible that the exercise won’t hurt my back but I’m just pushing myself too hard?",0

13708,"There’s a difference between a kind of twitching feeling and a pins and needles feeling. If your muscles are just twitching and shaking it means they’re working but not very strong yet and that’s something to work on and they will improve. But if you think this is more of a line and needles feeling, the position could be causing poor circulation of blood flood kinda like when you sit on your foot and it falls asleep. The problem is that this could mean you have a mobility issue that’s causing this and you might want to see a physician to make sure it won’t lead to injury. Always best to see a doctor with questions/concerns about your body. I could be completely wrong due to misinterpretation of the question. I’m just taking a best guess. So best see a professional to be sure. Hope this is helpful, best of luck to you!",0

13710,"Some of your most valuable pieces of equipment are your own two feet. Getting out and walking, hiking, running (if your body is up for it) and many other movements your could do on your feet to help yourself burn calories. But another way you can work to lose weight is simply with a couple different sets of dumbbells. Weight training doing compound movements and training styles for example complexes are a great way to burn calories and as well, build and develop active muscle tissue that will cause you to burn more calories throughout your day without you even working out. But above all else diet/nutrition is key, if you don’t get it right most of the time, there’s no amount of training that’ll make that body fat percentage go down. You don’t need to be perfect but you should be making good choices I’d say 70-80% of the time throughout a week. Don’t allow for too many junk calories or your progress won’t be significant. Stay dedicated and set up a plan for yourself and stick with it. I love to put the math behind it. Look at it like this. You wanna loose 60lbs of fat. 1lb of fat = approx 3600 calories. 60 X 3600 is 216000 calories. That means a total deficit over time needs to total 216000 calories for you to have lost that body fat. If you stay in a consistent deficit of 300 calories a day. In two years you’ll be down 60 lbs. And 300 is only a little deficit if you restrain back 300 calories from you diet a day and burn another 200 from physical training each day (deficit total equaling 500cals now) you could be down the body fat in 14 months. That’s not as far away as it seems. I know this might have not been the most direct answer to your question you were looking for but I hope it was helpful and I wish you the best of luck!",0
13711,"They’re welded on unfortunately but the wheels does force you to keep form straight and not use momentum for the pull. The stricter you are, the less movement from the rails",0
13712,"First, congratulations on the 50+ pounds of weight loss! That’s absolutely amazing! Next, I am not a nutritionist so I could be mistaken and I’m not going to question your friends education if they have good verifications. But I do question the reasoning behind consuming different types of healthy fats. From my understanding the body stores mainly 2 types of fat that gets referred too as body fat (visceral fat, which builds around your organs, and  subcutaneous fat, that builds up just underneath the skin. I don’t know the molecule structure of those fats and if it makes a difference, but from what I understand is that unsaturated (healthy) fats play a key role in regulating and helping construct our bodies hormones. And, depending on your biological gender, our hormones play a major role in impacting our body fat levels. We know that we can not train and diet to target fat in one area, that is a myth, but whether adding unsaturated fats makes a differences in what your body is storing, it’s all about trial and error. Don’t be afraid to experiment. As long as you’re still eating healthily you’re not going to disrupt your weight so much that if you find that method doesn’t work you can get back down. I’d say you’re already pretty locked in for what you’re doing just because of what you’ve accomplished already (again, that’s awesome, congrats!) Our bodies are complex, and no one person is the same. Maybe what your friend said is true but your body still doesn’t respond to it. You won’t know until you try. For exercises, I admire the simplicity. To many programs over complicate themselves in order to look fancy and it’s just not necessary. I would recommend though if available find some ways to 1) incorporate more pulling work and shoulder external rotation (look it up to much to explain) This way you won’t cause unwanted imbalances in your shoulder girdle. 2) Again, if available, try finding some exercises that work your muscles hard while also carrying a high conditioning component (ex: KettleBell swings, running/jogging stairs, jump squats etc...) these exercises do two things: they have a higher caloric burn per minute rate (on average) and as well breaking down muscle tissue like the other exercises will make the muscle tissue more metabolically demanding because of its need to rebuild and recover after the workout therefore you burn more calories throughout a day. Finally, no matter what exercises you do and what you eat, consistency and dedication is what matters to make a change. 50+ lbs of weight loss over 2ish years is an incredible change and you should be proud of that. And now I would start making it a challenge to find what your physical limitations are right now and work towards being able to do that thing (ex: you can only do 3 pull ups) make it your ambition to be able to do 20 and let your training and nutrition do what it has to do and go where it has to go to get you to that goal. Do what you want to accomplish because you have proven to yourself already that you can freaking do anything so it’s just a matter of taking that next step. I hope this is meaningful/helpful, and my best of luck to you! My apologies for this becoming a huge thing my bad 😅",0

13717,"A lot of it comes down to experimenting and finding what’s comfortable. If you’re not feeling the contraction at the top of the movement I would try maybe widening you knees or pointing your feet outward. That will help allow you knees to handle the length of a hip extension. And if your think your ROM is involved with getting the stretch, then try putting your feet on a couch or anything elevated to increase how low you can go. I would check out some other exercises for glutes because not all exercises work for everyone so maybe hip thrusts aren’t your best exercise. I hope this is helpful and best of luck!",0

Body transformations take a long time to see a difference and because it takes long we usually don't notice. You don't want to go by the scale either that can trick you as you gain muscle and lose fat you might not see much difference. The real thing to look for is the numbers... as in the time on the treadmill, distance run or cycled, doing more reps or weight getting heavier, pull ups or push ups or whatever you're doing. You keep track of that, be consistent, you will see the numbers go up, and you will see it improve pretty quick. Let those numbers be your motivation.",0

Push movements I like are push ups, military press, and dips. Pull movements I like are upright rows, pull ups or lat pulls. Leg movements could be air squats, split squats, one legged chair squats. Core movements can be sit ups, planks, supermans, side planks, v-ups. This is a very basic routine that does pretty good for full body.

Walk for a week or two, slow jog for the next week or two, less slow jog, and keep pushing in to it. Also, home yoga? Low impact, mellow, stretches your muscles and gets them used to working a bit. Home body weight exercises? Great! Air squats, with variations to make them more difficult as you progress. Push ups from your knees, and eventually progress to only hands and feet on the ground.

13748,"If your main goal is to lose weight, the most important thing is your diet. Look up “calorie deficit calculator” online and you’ll be able to get at least a rough idea of how many calories per day you should be consuming to lose X amount of weight over Y amount of time, based on your height, weight and activity level. Set yourself a clear weight goal and stick to that timeline. Also try to make sure that your calories are spread across healthier foods (think mixed nuts/fruit as a snack instead of cookies, which were my Achilles heel!).

The most important thing is keeping track of your calorie intake and being honest with yourself! Exercise is important too, because the calories you burn will increase your deficit, but you can’t rely on exercise alone to lose weight. It’s also I think important you don’t try to rush. I’ve lost just over 40lbs myself in the past year, and it’s not felt too much like hard work because it was a gradual process, rather than a big instant change.

As to which is better between running and cycling, generally speaking running will burn calories a little quicker, whereas cycling is lower-impact so you’re perhaps less likely to get injured. If you are overweight, cycling will put less strain on your joints, especially your knees, but I am no expert so it is worth you doing some further reading there. In my experience a lot of it comes down to preference - you have to find something which doesn’t feel like a chore or you won’t want to do it! 

When I started my own journey last March I tried a lot of different exercise types and ended up settling on running because it is inexpensive and you can do it anywhere. I did a “couch to 5k” plan over a few months and now I do ~3 runs a week, usually between 5-8k (3-5 miles), so not crazy distances! Then last summer I tried bouldering with a friend a couple of times and loved it! A bouldering gym opened up in my town in November, so I added one evening of climbing a week to my schedule, and then upped that to 2 evenings once my body started getting used to the strain.

So I would say focus on your calorie intake initially, see if you can find a sport/exercise/workout or two that you love and just stick with it!",0

13751,"Hello i think you should primarily focus on improving your quality of food instead of counting calories. You don't need to lose more weight. (if 120lb is 54kg as i goggled).
If your goal is building muscle you should eat properly so that your body gets all the nutrition it needs. Including healthy fat and mainly protein.
Eat nutritious breakfast with nuts seeds (don't forget to soak them in water overnight in order to make them more easily digestible and unlock the nutrients) or eggs. Then for your lunch and dinner chose some vegetables and combine with meat fish or plant source of protein.
Eat real food cooked at home from scratch.
Don't be afraid to increase your calories to 2000 (or even more) and incorporate heavier weights and more intense strength training it would be best hire a coach in the beginning or go to fb group called Women who lift for inspiration.
I think 160 0 calories is too low for a growing and developing girl you shouldn't lose weight you should lose fat and gain muscle at the same time so ideally your weight should stay the same only your body should look and feel better your goal is to take progress photos and waist measurements not weight

So within here are 6 exercises. 3 you can automatically do because they are bodyweight. For rollout you may have some sort of ball or chair that can be used as an assistance. For the suitcase hold use any heavy object such as a milk jug.

**Back:**

THIS is where it gets tricky. Back work without dumbbells for rowing or a pull up bar at this house gets tough. These two are creative options (The second video is a progression from the first video):

 [https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKfjQqBMVE/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKfjQqBMVE/) 

Hah :D 

I won't force her into doing anything related to fitness. As for now, she sees me working out, tries to mimic me and seems to have fun.

Sooner or later she'll pick it up as well, but I want it to be out of her own interest. 

Does that make sense to you? :)",0
13832,"The quiet aspect is obviously the most challenging and I’m in the same boat having normally been doing two a day and high intensity with heavy and explosive weight training. Being a trainer myself, my thoughts go to time under tension style mixing with a complimentary high intensity exercise. 
So for example do this combo without rest besides transition:
1. Partial Squat (do not go all the way up) x:45
2. Wide Stance Pulse Squats x:45
3. Quick Feet (:10 wide (stance), :10 narrow, :10 wide)
4. Low squat jumping jacks x :30

So you work the muscle with straining while constantly holding your BW or additional weight up without reaching a resting position. Then changing to fast twitch muscle fibers while also endurance. This will shout up the heart rate and challenge your cardiovascular training. 

A style like that could meet your criteria. Keep with it! We will get through this together.",0
13833,"My landlady lives below me with her elderly grandfather, and they're awesome, so I doubly don't want to bother them with my workout noise. I found low-impact cardio to be both challenging and a solid workout.

13848,"It's been 5 days since last time I did a workout. Even if you’re completely dedicated to your fitness plan, sometimes working out can be the last thing you want to do. The dishes in the sink are piling up or you're behind on whatever else around the house, excuses are easy to find but truth is that I haven't been feeling it lately. I haven't felt so motivated to workout and kept my self ""busy"" doing everything else around the house but working out. Some times we are looking for an extra reason ""why"" I should workout. We all get those days where we have no motivation because we are human and no one is perfect. Which is okay! 
Sometimes when you remind your self of where you've been, you'll feel more motivated to look ahead to the future. If there is no struggle, there is no progress. I still don't feel like it, but I can not always do what feels good. We need to step out of our comfort zones and do it! Without sacrifice there can be no victory. One life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it. We need to be willing to sacrifice what we are today for what we can become tomorrow. I don't know why I post pictures when I am running low on motivation where I don't look my best 🤦‍♀️but looking back at this makes me feel motivated to continue and remind my self that as long as I continue and don't stop growth will continue. It's time for a workout💪 I hope you feel motivated with my words.",0

13858,The biggest muscle in your body is your gluteus Maximus.  Squats and lunges will burn the most calories. Those are also compound movements that engage even more muscles. Burpees are either  loved or hated. Learn to love them. Do them with a push-up and a jump up at the end. You can’t spot train so concentrate on the big movements.,0
13859,Not sure anyone will be able to really tell you online but I know that since I started  to use a foam roller on my upper back and lats after every workout I recover much faster and the soreness is much less. I have one that is about 18” wide as has a variety of knobs and ridges.,0

13861,"I got motivated to get back into fitness after I turned 50. I started out with resistance bands because they are low impact, safe at home, mobile, and you can use them even for recovery or if you get injured. I bought the Bodylastics. I found that I didn’t get overly sore with them and could easily work out at least every other day. I am now 60 and use all kinds of things. Getting warmed up and stretching after is important no matter what your age. I now also like the loop bands that look like rubber bands. They are even more mobile although either work great if you know what to do. Good luck. You are still young. Never let age be a deterrent!",0
13862,I can do 10-15 on my own. But I have started using bands because it allows me to get my chest to the bar. Much better stretch and works my back better. So not just for beginners!,0

I’m not that overweight, I’m pretty much one mark off of a normal BMI, but I have a lot of visceral fat that I’ve been attempting to get rid of. I’ll try adding some cardio exercises into my routine and I’ll do all also try the time thing tomorrow morning. Thanks for the advice it helps a lot!",0
13866,There is hardly anything better the Burpees for weight lose. Especially if you have no equipment.,0
13867,There's a sub for this called bodyweightexercises,0
13868,"With a lot of body weight exercises it’s not ideal to stick with sets and reps just because the intensity is based on your strength levels and your bodyweight. I would advice sticking with what the first comment said and 3x(however many reps) but I would recommend increasing your rep number and making it a challenge to complete that rep per time. (Example: you’re doing 3 sets of make it say 20 reps. Challenge yourself to complete all 20 in a one minute period. Whether that be doing 5, resting a few seconds, do another 5, etc... until you reach 20) what’s going to happen is you’re adding a pressure to preform a certain higher level of energy out put in a period of time. This translates to a greater amount of work done with each set and you’ll find that you’re actually going to get stronger because you’re challenging yourself harder than you probably are with just 3 sets of 8. Even if your limit is 8 reps for the exercise, challenge yourself to get 12-15 done in a little more time per set. I would encourage you try this with all your exercises. And as was said about fat burning, nothing in that workout is going to cause a high calorie burn, but you will be causing an increase in what’s called your base metabolic rate because your body is going to consume more calories to repair and maintain muscle tissue. So it will work it’s just not as extreme when it comes to weight loss as you may be expecting. Maybe add some light low impact cardio exercises such as my climbers, marches, or maybe even just walking. That’s it, hope this is helpful good luck!",0

13875,"Not bad.  Forget the cute pyramid stuff, that's a gimmick.  Do 3 sets, same number of reps you can do.  When you get to 3x8 is pretty easy, you need to progress to something more difficult.

You also need to ad in dips, rows, and pullups.  All your exercises are push, you need some pull.

Finally, just realize these exercises won't burn much fat.  Almost all fat loss is due to eating less, period.",0

13885,"Yes its not easy.  I find with my clients I see for weight loss and exercise its continual reinforcement and messaging in order to keep them on track.  There is no quick fix for this - once you accept that and build healthy habits around exercise then you can really make it part of your life instead of a chore!  

Glad it helped!",0
13886,"Thoughts:  


\- A lot of the reading I've done here/elsewhere on the net suggests situps aren't really that useful as a shaping/definition exercise. You might get better results from your workouts by replacing them with leg lifts or bicycle situps. I'm not sure how viable leg lifts will be with your knees (they don't use them, but you *do* need to keep your legs straight for the whole set), but bicycle situps should be fine unless your knees are causing you issues from simple bending/straightening. Take it slow to start with if you try it, see how you feel.

Russian twists are another good core exercise that's fairly easy to do, and you can up the intensity of the workout by adding holding exercise ball or other weight while you do them.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Something I discovered in the course of my body recomposition research is that not all belly fat is created equal. Sometimes we overlook the importance of building up our posterior chain muscles (the muscles on the rear of the body) alongside those we see when we look in the mirror. If you hit a plateau with your weight loss and find you still don't quite have a flat belly, the issue may actually be your glutes/back muscles not being used as much as they should be. This can cause injuries and issues when working out your front muscles, particularly if you start to build mass. Your squats and lunges will help here for glutes/hamstrings; if you're not doing them already, I'd add dumbbell cleans/deadlifts to the mix as well.

Another, related area of interest with postural paunch is your pelvic tilt; if you've an overly pronounced anterior pelvic tilt, you may benefit quite a bit from dead hangs and pullups. Particularly if you find yourself experiencing back pain or injuries as a result of working your posterior chain.",0

13889,"Thanks for comment. I agree I can improve my glutes. I don’t know if it’s the way I’m built or the range of motion, but think when I squat and deadlift, my hamstrings and quads naturally do most of the work (even though I flex my glutes when I come up from each squat). When I squat, I go down to parallel, but maybe squatting below parallel will force me to use my glutes more.",0

13891,"Hey, thank you for your comment! I’ll definitely take your advice. I’ve been doing chin ups for the last 6 months, and I’ve gone from barely being able to do a few to now doing 5 sets of 5. I just started doing pulls ups last week and I was only able to do 4, total. I know pull ups are generally more challenging because your biceps aren’t nearly as involved, but wow, I feel like it’s a completely different workout. I’m not sure if it’s the way I’m built, but I was really feeling it in my upper back for the next few days.

Shoulders are not built to bear weight that way.,0
13972,"Backstory and Goals:

I used to be skinny (160 pounds) and then I gained 45 pounds over the course of four years. I’ve been working on building muscle over the last year and a half and I’ve been less focused on losing weight. I definitely have gained muscle (and lost fat along the way), but I need to lose around 20 pounds to get to my goal of being toned and 180 pounds by this summer.

Workout Routine and Diet:

Each week I do (1) squats or deadlifts, (2) chin ups, (3) dips, and (4) abs to build muscle, and I just added a few days of cardio each week because I have now moved to the phase of my fitness journey where I want to prioritize losing fat. I eat around 2,400 calories each day, and 200+ grams of protein.

Self-Assessment:

When I look at the first and last photo (looking left to right, top to bottom), I think most of my work building muscle will be way more prominent when I get down to 180, and that if I maintain my current weight training and focus on adding cardio, I will be satisfied when I reach my goal weight. However, when I look at the second and third photo, my body looks kind of deformed, which may be exaggerated by the extra fat and/or the deficiencies in certain muscles I’ve been neglecting.

Questions:

1. Do I have any obvious muscles that are really underdeveloped, and that I should obviously be prioritizing in order to enhance my torso and get closer to my stated goals?

2. Is 180 a good weight goal if I want to just be toned, and don’t plan to add a lot more muscle.

3. My back in particular sometimes looks truncated (see photo 2 and 3), but I think I may just have a short torso for 6’1”. Sometimes I think I would benefit from yoga/stretching and maybe even seeing a chiropractor, but I’m not sure how much I would benefit from an aesthetic point of view from any of this. Is there a strong argument to be made based on those photos that I would benefit from any of this?

13988,A press-up uses mostly your chest but also your front shoulders and triceps as well (depending on how you choose to do them). It could be that any one of those muscle groups is limiting your progression. Whichever of them fails first might be bottlenecking your press-up ability.,0

14001,There's an article about women and pullups. In the study they took a group of women that couldn't do a single pull-up. They put them on a pull-up specific program I think for 6 weeks. At the end of the program there was only a couple of women that could do one pull-up. It's a good article. Google women and pull-ups I'm sure it'll pop up. The point of the article was that some women genetically don't have the upper body strength to do upper body strength movements. The important part is to keep moving. Well done on your weight loss!,0

14004,"You only really need to work out each muscle group once or twice a week. People that work out daily split the muscle groups into different days and do cardio only on some. I do a push/pull/legs split (no cardio) so that’s each muscle group worked every 6 days. My DOMs lasts 2-4 days on average. You need to rest and fuel until the soreness is gone or at least dull or you’ll overwork the muscles which stops them from being able to get stronger. My “push” home workout last night was push-ups, and flys with resistance bands and my TRX, skull crushers, and dips. Check out Instagram for home exercises, it’s exploding with them right now!",0
14005,"Keep working on it. Vary your exercise selection, rep scheme and tempo. And I would recommend avoiding push-ups from your knees. It's too easy to cheat by shifting your hips back. Make the exercise easier by keeping your feet on the floor and elevating your hands.",0
14006,Yes. Genetics. But there's things you can do. My opinion is doing incline pushups is the best thing you can do and can do anywhere. Find anything around 2 and half to 3 feet high. Put your hands on it and do pushups. Do sets of 8-10. As the sets become easier find something lower.,0

14048,"Backstory and Goals:

I‘m in my 30s, 6’1” and 200 pounds. I used to be skinny (160 pounds) and then I gained 45 pounds over the course of four years. I’ve been working on building muscle over the last year and a half and I’ve been less focused on losing weight. I definitely have gained muscle (and lost fat along the way), but I need to lose around 20 pounds to get to my goal of being toned and 180 pounds by this summer.

Workout Routine and Diet:

Each week I do (1) squats or deadlifts, (2) chin ups, (3) dips, and (4) abs to build muscle, and I just added a few days of cardio each week because I have now moved to the phase of my fitness journey where I want to prioritize losing fat. I eat around 2,400 calories each day, and 200+ grams of protein.

Self-Assessment:

When I look at the first and last photo (looking left to right, top to bottom), I think most of my work building muscle will be way more prominent when I get down to 180, and that if I maintain my current weight training and focus on adding cardio, I will be satisfied when I reach my goal weight. However, when I look at the second and third photo, my body looks kind of deformed, which may be exaggerated by the extra fat and/or the deficiencies in certain muscles I’ve been neglecting.

Questions:

1. Looking at those photos, are there any obvious muscles that are really underdeveloped, and that I should obviously be prioritizing in order to enhance my torso and get closer to my stated goals?
2. Is 180 a good weight goal if I want to just be toned, and don’t plan to add a lot more muscle.
3. My back in particular sometimes looks truncated (see photo 2 and 3), but I think I may just have a short torso for 6’1”. Sometimes I think I would benefit from yoga/stretching and maybe even seeing a chiropractor, but I’m not sure how much I would benefit from an aesthetic point of view from any of this. Is there a strong argument to be made based on those photos that I would benefit from any of this?

I know that’s a lot, but I’m hoping someone more experienced than myself can help me make the most of this quarantine and give me the advice I need to reach my fitness goals. Thanks in advance!",0

Day 3 - stretch for 10 mins and clear a path to the elliptical 
Day 4 - stretch for 10 mins and 10 mins on elliptical (lowest and easiest setting)
Day 5 - stretch 
Day 6 - 12 mins on elliptical + stretch 
Day 7 - 15 min on elliptical + stretch 

Once you hit 25 mins start upping the intensity slowly and add calisthenics. Check out the minimal routine on the body weight sub.

Hand placement: decent, but could bring them in slightly. Should be about shoulder width or slightly wider. Not a huge concern here. 

Elbows: its hard to tell from this angle but elbows should be about 45° from your body and it seems like you go a bit wider than that. 

Depth: try to go down so your arms are parallel to the ground. So a little deeper than your starting reps. 

Head: pick a spot a few feet in front of you and stare it down. This will pick your head up a bit which is the recommended form. 

Body: kept a nice straight form, so keep that up. Its easy to arch and you didnt seem to have that problem. 

Final thoughts: in general they looked pretty good, so dont take this as overly critical. Just trying to fine tune your form to help you get the most out of it. Even if your form isnt perfect some is better than none so keep knocking them out.",0

14177,"Hypertrophy training has a general focus of 8-15 reps with a 5+ RPE (rate of perceived exertion). It has been shown that you can see muscle growth anywhere from 1 to like 40 reps so long as the stimulus is challenging enough (reps should be taken to the point of considerable fatigue). So light vs heavy weight doesnt necessarily matter for gains. Most of your training will fall into the 8-15 range for this because it will allow you to stay at an intensity which allows for more overall volume without generating considerable fatigue. There is a clear linear relationship with volume and hypertrophy (volume=total sets/reps throughout week) . If you are a beginner in the gym you could pretty much do anything and see gains, so make an easy full body routine that you can do 2-3x per week (2 is better than 1 but 3 might not be better than 2, according to available research) at about 2-4 sets of 8-15 reps per exercise. Reps should be taken to 2 or less reps in reserve (how many more reps you think you could have done by the time you stopped) to ensure proper stimulus. Those are the general guidelines, most training at moderate-heavy weight within 8-15 rep range, i would still recommend certain exercises to have a strength focused intensity and reps. So if your a newbie, coming off a break, or have never really stuck to a program i would again do a fully body workout that has a horizontal/vertical push and pull (push up, bench/dumbbell press, overhead press, seated/bent over row, lat pulldown or pull ups) for your upper body and some type of squat or deadlifting pattern for lower body. For most beginners you can honestly just do something as simple as push ups, seated row, rdl, and squat and do great for starting out.

The alternative, if you have access to a pull-up bar and resistance band, hook the band around the bar then your waist then try the standing rollout. The resistance band would ease the pressure on your back whilst still making you engage your core to keep stable.

If you’re not all all comfortable with it, work on progressions such as extended plank holds and other stability core exercises (plenty on YT) to condition the core for this type of load.

14272,"Thank you for your reply :)

Their response to higher intensity exercise is a heck yes to swimming, and they really don't know where to put me at for other types that don't utilize water. Even some of thier low intensity exercises they had me try were making some symptoms worse so I couldn't do them. It's really hard because the leg issues are rare. Them and I have had to accept that because I've had to hold back on certain things, certain parts of my body have to pay for it too. Like less lower leg engagement means tighter hips, glute and calf deactivation. So, even though more walking and planter flexion would help in ways, it's contraindicated for my leg syndromes.  So some of it really is catch 22. Thier upper body exercises were really helping my range of motion, regain feeling, and reduce pain. Too soon to notice any strength gains. Unfortunately even with that, there's only so much my upper body can progress because the cervical fusion progressively limits me. The core work, doesn't mess with the cervical or leg issues so that has been well. But again, it's nothing truly high intensity high heart rate high calorie burning type. 

My leg syndromes, some that have it, can just stop running and they're great to do everything else with their legs... that's how it used to be for me. But me, like some, it gets progressively worse. It also didn't help that before I found out, I was making it worse running on it. Then after finding out, several failed  surgeries later, I've had to be on my feet just to work and survive. I can't lay down and sit all day. Yet I am more and more and I hate it.",0

You can do conditioning exercises to help improve form, such as:

• plank (straight arm) with scapula protracted
• ab rollout against a wall to make it slightly easier rolling back
• hollow body rocks

(Which tabata is still a decent way to train as well, it’s just more like HIIT) Complexes aren’t really based on time. They’re more like a ladder of exercises done back, to back, to back, without resting between exercises. There’s no real time component, they’re more often done with rep schemes. And for your kids, this wouldn’t be a bad time to start introducing them how to start doing some conscious physical exercise.

I was at the point where my dr said I didn’t necessarily need the surgery but I would qualify if I opted for it. My back always hurt no matter what so I went for it. I lost a lot of blood so I did have to have a transfusion. I was really dependent on my parents when I went home. I had to have someone help me get out of bed, get off the couch, even to shower and wipe my ass (lol but seriously!) but it was probably 4 weeks of that. I had the surgery in July and returned to my senior year of high school on the first day of school. I have to have back support when sitting like I can’t do bleachers it’s uncomfortable for me.

14303,"I have kyphosis and lumbar scoliosis - you will want to really target your core, it helps a lot with the pain. I’ve been told swimming is fantastic, and that you should just avoid exercises that make you bend at the sides. That makes sense to me because my curve makes it so that I can only comfortably sleep on one side. Otherwise, you’re good! Don’t let it stop you. You need a stronger core/back than most so don’t be afraid to work it. 

Also, yeah, a follow up would be great but most people do just have idiopathic scoliosis and your curve probably won’t progress too much as an adult. I don’t have insurance but when I did I saw specialists that essentially said the above and that the biggest problem was really just aesthetic and comfort. I used to wear a back brace for pain management, not correction, but it was more uncomfortable than my scoliosis. 

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions!",0
14304,"I don’t know if you’re just looking for cardio alternatives or if you also do anaerobic workouts as well. But if you do do anaerobic workouts I would recommend looking into doing DB and BB complexes. The last 2 months or so I’ve been preforming elongated complexes to improve my strength and my conditioning functionally together and holy hell they’re hard. As a result, I’ve gotten in to much improved shape compared to where I was when I started them and they can be done relatively quick too. Basically what they are is a systematic layout of exercises that ladder down from an exercise that targets the weakest muscle groups all the way to your strongest muscle groups. You preform a certain number of reps for each exercise and then use the same weight (Whether be DB,BB, or Bodyweight) to continue on to the next exercise without rest. You rest after you’ve completed all the exercises in the complex. Search them up on YouTube to see people preform them and they’ll make more sense. But the benefit could be virtually no impact on your knees (based on exercises selection) and very intense conditioning session that could very well have you on your knees (no pun intended) after just a couple rounds. I’d highly check them out. They’re currently my favorite way to train and depending on how you usually train, they could be a good alternative for when you don’t have time for long duration cardio. Hope this is helpful and good luck!",0

14337,"So believe it or not, this is the same as any other “high”, yes the kind you get from drugs. It sounds like you’re addicted, but this type isn’t as readily available.  

Your body gains a tolerance to your movements and the threshold for your high is changed. 

In my experience the best way to continue to gain this high is to push yourself and keep it highly variable. HIIT, lift heavy (with good form), run further, run faster. It sounds to me like your body enjoys change and variation (though your anxiety might not). 

You can also try to retrain your brain by convincing yourself after and during each workout that this is the best workout, you’re killing it, and it’s awesome.

The price varies on your starting point and end goal. The way I see it, if I don’t get my health in check I’ll be spending way more than a one time payment of $180 for medications to treat health issues related to obesity. And if someone told me I could pay $180 to love myself and be confident again without medication, I would jump on it. So I did it.

Everyone who tries Keto gets amazing and quick results but can’t stick to the diet their whole lives. I signed up for Noom. It has completely changed my relationship with food and my lifestyle. It helped me deal with the mental behind my emotional eating and taught me about reading food labels, clean eating, and how to kick my depression when it hits.

Lifting weights burns FAR LESS calories than low intensity steady state cardio does in the same amount of time. Using a treadmill on a good incline like +10% less than 4 mph.

If 30 mins is too much, start going on 2 separate 20 minute runs and build it up.

14459,"Yep never lifted weights. I wanted to see how far I could push my body without it and so far I’ve noticed the most important element is really your genetic limit as opposed to training method. I have 2 other bros, who have been training for about 10 years too. Despite them only training with weights we all have comparable mass and builds relative to our heights, and all our growth has dramatically slowed down in recent years hinting to the fact that we’ve almost reached or natural limits. 
So training method isn’t all too important as long as you understand muscle hypertrophy, ensure you achieve progressive overload, ensure your eating at a caloric surplus when training to gain mass and keeping check on your protein levels (I shoot for 1.5-2g per kg of bodyweight).
The limitations I’ve found around bodyweight so far include training particular muscles- you need to be creative or it is easy to neglect some muscles and you’ll end up with imbalances but I’ve learnt how to fix these overtime by creating new unique exercises to compensate. It’s also technically harder to achieve progressive overload than weights- I have to learn new moves and refine these before I can use them effectively to gain mass. Gym bro?- just increase the weight and it’s that simple 😂
It is rewarding despite these limitations though.

14471,"The trick for me was to find something fun to do that ALSO doubled as a full body workout. I could never get motivated to do several reps of something and then repeat. It didn't occupy my brain enough to zone out and get the workout done. It was just me...standing...doing a heavy thing. But i LOVED pole dancing because the music and the movement and motivating enough. And it's just FUN. Even when you suck at it. Obviously pole dancing isn't the answer for everyone but it's about finding something that gives you a good balance of what your body and your mind want. Then, after a while your body will crave that movement more and more. So it may be worth looking into things like yoga, hiking, climbing, cycling, dancing, rope darting, poi, martial arts, parkour, hooping, aerials, larping, devil sticks, crossfit routines, or even just playing on playground equipment like a child again. Whatever gets you moving in a way that you're having so much fun, you forget that you're working out. Be sore for a few days, have more fun, repeat. Plus it takes a lot of pressure of workout goals off of you. You're just indulging a new hobby you want to get good at. :)",0
14472,"Thing with squats is that they definitely develop muscle in the glutes but significantly less than the quads. So it isn't the best exercise for women looking to specifically gain glute mass and keep thighs smaller. Hip thrusts, glute focused back extensions, Bulgarian split squats, American deadlifts, and all of your smaller glute exercises (donkey kicks, banded work, etc). Would be great for focusing on just your butt. The gains may be slower but you'd be working, mostly, on that one area. But by all means, if you want to grow the quads as well, squats are fantastic.",0

Squats are still a great exercise for the glutes, and can be loaded really well over time.

14493,Well what about your other muscles?,0
14494,is it? i like to enhance my upper but if it has negative or uselss effects then im willing to adjust my routine.,0
14495,"Basically what it sounds like you’re saying you want to do is have a way to reduce or at least maintain your body fat level and keeping it from going up. Varying core exercises will be good to maintain a toned mid-section but it’s not going to help burn the calories you’ll need to to prevent gaining weight. What I would recommend is start doing some basic  bodyweight/calisthenic exercises for your entire body. Exercises such as: push ups, squats, lunges, pull ups/chin ups (if you can find a place for them and any place you can do a pulling exercise) What you’ll do is break down muscle tissue which we know is what needs to be done to spark new growth. But what this also does is while your body recognizes it needs to repair itself, your body becomes more metabolically demanding thus burning more calories throughout a day even when you’re not actively working out. This could be a major component to keeping yourself from gaining unwanted fat. I would recommend doing a moderate intensity full body workout every second day or so. What this will do is keep your body in a recovery/metabolic state causing you to burn more calories. I would recommend trying to do your exercises with as little rest between each other and between sets as to keep your HeartRate up as well. Finally, finish your workout with some form of cardio whether be an exercise like Jacks, my climbers, burpees, etc.... With your body at a fatigued state, what will happen is your body will actually have to work harder to maintain form and preform the lighter aerobic exercises. Then the last reminder is nutrition is everything. You can’t out train a bad diet. So it’s important to watch your calorie intake as to not kill the progress you’re making with your workouts. I hope this is helpful, best of luck to you!",0

14555,"Our bodies don’t understand time. They only understand necessity and opportunity. When you workout and break down muscle tissue, your body will recognize that it’s going to need to use protein to rebuild that damage. So when you finally consume protein or if you had already consumed protein, your body will use it. Don’t listen to people saying there are these windows of time of day of eating that work better than others, it’s simply not true. Our bodies will consume what nutrients we provide them and do whatever they can with what they got and it will dispose of what it doesn’t want/need. Just focus on getting in your necessary amount of protein a day however your eating habits see best and your body will do its job as long as you do yours. Hope this is helpful, best of luck!",0
14556,"Biking, swimming, running, calisthenics; would likely all benefit you.  The best thing you could do is simply find what excites you. Whether be something old or something new. As soon as you find a routine or style of training that excites you to the point that you can’t wait to do it everyday or however many days you train, you will be motivated unlike anything you’d believe. You’ve got to enjoy what you do to truly be able to stay consistent. Even if it’s nothing that anybody listed in the chat. Find a style of exercise that you like, and fall in love with it and make it your own. Hope this is helpful for you, best of luck!",0

14558,"What’s probably happening is your stomach is expanding after having eaten and you’re abs are being extended just a bit making them not look as good and or visible. Likely your body fat is just high enough that you have what’s called shadow abs and you can see them in the right light or right angle but as soon as you bloat or as soon as you stop flexing they’re not visible anymore. It’s not a bad thing but for a lot of people with “abs” it’s a reality check. To have solid appearing abs you need to be at like 10% bf or lower. I wouldn’t obsess about it. Just maintain a healthy diet and keep up your routine and you’ll probably end up looking a lot better than most people your age in the coming years. Hope this is helpful, good luck!",0
14559,"If you want something that’s different, challenging, and could potentially help your knees, and kills time; try yoga. Yoga is honestly a lot of fun! You don’t need any equipment and you can find plenty of instructional vids on YouTube. I’d try it out. It may also help you keep your sanity with all the stress going on right now. Hope this is helpful and best of luck and good health to you over in Spain! Stay healthy.",0
14560,Thanks a lot! This helps a lot. I might have the same situation as you but I will consult a doctor for sure. I live in Chicago so this temperature thing kinda makes sense. Thanks again!,0
14561,"I couldn’t tell you for sure. But I’ve had a similar experience with training during the winter. I live in Michigan so the winters are a bitch. I’d walk from where I was living at the time to the gym and get on an elliptical to warm up and my legs and sometimes my arms would not break out in hives but become very irritated and itchy. But like you said after about 5-8 minutes or so it goes away. I personally have really sensitive skin so I’ve  always assumed that it’s just my skin reacting poorly to being really cold and then warming up really fast (plus it doesn’t help as you start to sweat) But this only happens in the winter and I have never had any other affects with my health from it so if your case is the same as mine then it could just be your skin doesn’t like going from cold to hot and that’s why you break out. Take this with a grain of salt though because it’s always best to ask a doctor. Hope this is helpful and helps ease your mind a bit, good luck!",0
14562,"Depends on how you feel. If you feel good and decently strong or stronger workout to workout, then you’re probably fine. Overtraining is a muscular and neurological fatigue through your body that occurs when you do too much physical work with not enough recovery time between sessions. If you were over trained you would feel off. Doing the exercises would hurt often and you wouldn’t always be sore but it wouldn’t feel right. You’ll feel weaker in general even at the start of your workout. You’d feel lethargic and tired but when you try to sleep, it’s likely you won’t be able to fall asleep or not sleep very well. Even things like your mood could be affected. Just watch out for symptoms like that. And if you do at some point experience symptoms like that just give yourself a couple days off and maybe adjust your routine, but if you’ve been doing this for a while and have no problems then you’re probably okay.  Hope this is helpful, good luck!",0
14563,"Awesome, always find a way. No excuses.",0
14564,"If your problem is learning to engage the chest some simple tips are:
-Keep shoulders back through every pressing exercise
-any cable crossover/fly exercise control it and go through full range of motion
-finally, try something like dips and go as low as you can. Feel the stretch of your chest as you try to press away and you’ll actually begin to feel where, and how to flex your chest

If you’re simply trying to get it bigger but can engage it, simply the quality of the reps beat the quantity of the reps. 
Hope this is helpful, good luck!",0
14566,"I can’t promise anything but you could possibly spark some growth by doing some simple muscle workouts (If you’re not doing anything already). Doing things like push ups, pull ups, squats, etc.... By doing this you’ll spark some hormone productions in your body that could add some height and size depending on how old you are. As well something more practical that often gets over looked is improving your standing posture. Corrective exercises to work on fixing a slouched upper back and rounded shoulders could make a big difference on how you visibly appear to people around you. Finally, if in the end you only come to stay at 5,3 you’ve gotta learn to just accept it and EMBRACE IT. Embrace the things about you that make you who you are, move on, and enjoy life!

The trainers at my private gym certainly aren’t making tons of money and I can afford to spot them while they are closed. 
Now if you are financially impacted then that’s a different story. You have to cut expenses everywhere you can and in this case you would have every right to cancel. It wouldn’t hold up in a court as the online classes don’t allow you access to the facilities you’re paying for.

14636,"I had a lot of experience going to PTs for 10 years when I got injured in water polo my freshman year of highschool. My advice to you is go and see a physical therapist to know what the problem is and how to fix it. If its not causing you pain then you are already ahead of most people who go to physical therapists who have pain. The therapist will probably give you exercises to fix the problem, if theres any at all (its possible that what you have is structural). From what I understand from your post, you either have one shoulder more elevated or one shoulder blade more winging compared to the other. Maybe the numbers are the distance of the scapula from the spine since she was checking your back for scoliosis and if your spine curves then there will be musclular imbalance and the scapulas might be at different distances from the spine. As you can see it could be a variety of things. You can spend a lot of time guessing and trying to find whats wrong but you are 15 and probably dont know much about anatomy and different muscular problems that can happen. So I suggest you go see a physical therapist to at least know what the problem is and then you can do the exercises to correct it at home to save money. Hope this helps.",0

14638,"Overall calorie and protein consumption seems to be the first priority but optimally, from what I understand if you've consumed adequate protein prior to exercise it's less of a need to immediately consume post. If you don't eat within a couple of hours, it does become more important to do so. You're body has periods where it can optimize protein intake but it isn't a specific hour and then it's done. Long story short, make sure you're eating enough grams per day as spread out as possible.",0

14647,"With that being said, physios and PTs spend a lot of time in school learning and understanding conditions and developing musculoskeletal balance. It is impossible to provide good and accurate care without seeing and feeling what is going on, making people apprehensive to provide an opinion. When it comes to scoliosis and other changes in the spine it is vital to strengthen in a specific way as you don’t want torque or pressure in certain areas preventing further injury and or discomfort. 

It may be worth it to just do a visit or two with a physio. Explain your situation and that you have limited resources/ funding. 

In the US you can often contact schools and they will have a student evaluate and treat you simply for the experience. No fee attached. I’m not sure this is a viable option in Finland but it may be worth looking in to.",0

14651,It’s hard to say what you can do without actually seeing/understanding what’s happening in your skeletal system and how it can be fixed. All at can recommend is go find some anatomy books and physiology books. Do your research and try to gain an understanding of what is wrong with your body in the first place. Then your oath will be made more clear on what you can do to fix it without the need for PT. Become the number 1 expert of your own body. That’s the best advice I’ve got for you.

14669,"Both variations will work your chest, triceps, and shoulders. But what changes is the emphasis level on each muscle. You may find a lot more Tricep fatigue with close grip because close grip extends the triceps range of motion. So definitely do both and you see for yourself how your body responds to it. In the end it all comes down to angles and physics. Hope this helps!",0
14670,"Overall, I like it. It’s a classic, straight forward, seeming well thought out muscle building routine. My only critique is with your chosen set and rep schemes for your major compound lifts for each workout (4x10, 4x8, 5x5) although they are all great I would suggest maybe a little bit more variation in your weeks. Though they’re all a bit different the sets and rep levels are all very similar leaving you between 25 and 40 reps a workout per major lift. I would suggest varying maybe one of the 4-sets and switching it to a lighter day making it say (example: 3x20) then keeping say one week (4x8-10) and the other your (5x5) Or an alternative could be manipulating the style of reps. Maybe the 4x8 could be pause reps and the 4x10 is standard and 5x5 is explosive (again just an example) these are some ideas. I don’t know your experience level in your training so it’s up to you to figure out what works best. Try things out and don’t be afraid to mix things up and experiment. Just because it’s written on paper doesn’t make it carves in stone. Hope this is helpful best of luck!",0
14671,"Although it sucks to have to be mindful of if you simply become aware of your approximations of how many calories, grams of protein, grams of fat, and grams of carbs/sugar; should help ease your anxieties with if your eating enough or too little. If you’re trying to lose weight, restricting your base calorie consumption by 200 calories or so a day plus sticking to your workout routine will make a difference with probably around 1-2lbs of fat loss per 10-14 days. Which is a very steady, stable, consistent, and healthy rate of loss. Plus including light aerobic work like walking and biking, you’ll burn some extra calories total per week that will not impact your muscle levels. Hope this is helpful good luck!",0
14672,"The cold can really bother your lungs just from having to breath through your mouth.

Unless it’s absolutely necessary running in temp below freezing isn’t very good for your lungs in general. And for now I wouldn’t run again until your coughing, etc... resides. Probably another day you’ll be fine. Hope this helps best of luck.",0

Avoid trying to 'catch up' to a healthy weight. Most people get impatient and fail at this because they are focused on results (which are slow) and/or try to speed things up in unsustainable ways. 

Pick something doable (500cal/d deficit) and do it. Then pick an exercise you LIKE to do, it doesn't matter what, and stick with that.

Fasting meant nothing to me, as I never ate breakfast for many years. And there's no way Im giving up beer or meat. So for me, had to find another way.  I started eating as light a lunch as possible.  Usually 300- 400 calories or so. Regular dinner, 1,000 calories.  No snacks, other than 100 calories tops. So roughly 1,500 calories.

But switched to 3x10 and that’s been so much easier on me. My off days is usually running for half hour and some abs. Or a hot yoga session.",0
14724,"It looks alright to me! The biggest thing is to run it for a while and see how you go. Anytime you make your own program it’s important to test it out for a while and see how it runs. You’ll know how each individual session feels once you’ve done it, and often you’ll find things during the execution that you didn’t consider when you first put it together. I know whenever I put together my training programs I tweak them after the first couple of weeks, often by adding or changing movements depending on how they feel and how I’m progressing. 

If anything feels like it isn’t working initially, give yourself a bit of time to see if it settles/improves, and if it doesn’t make some adjustments. In this case, it’s your program, and you can do what you want with it whenever you want to.

Objectively, this looks like it covers all the bases. I’d be aware that the volume looks like it might be a bit high, but I don’t know where your training tolerance is at. I’d also be aware of overdoing it on the off days, particularly since the volume of the listed days looks so high you want your recovery to be really good, but again I don’t know your training history or tolerance. 

Give it a crack and see how you go. You learn a lot from writing your own stuff about what works for you and what doesn’t, and the next one you put together will be better than the first, and so on and so forth.",0

14735,"You absolutely can. Of course it’ll take time to get over the hard part, and there will be some slip ups.. try not to be hard on yourself when you do slip up. “Tomorrow” is a new day.

Dim lights, turn off tv, take a warm shower, brush teeth, maybe a face mask. Grooming is a form of self love and can help you to relax. By 10pm be in bed and don’t leave your room. Allow yourself 15 minutes of screen time and then pick up a book or listen to music, a podcast or a meditation app. Try to be asleep by 11.

14736,"Thank you! I’m quite proud of me too! I’m approaching the 1 year anniversary of this commitment to myself.

My progress has been slow and steady.

My first step was exercise. Consistency is the key. You need to find something that you can and will do at least 4 times a week. For me it was low impact HIIT classes at the gym, mine had a rowing class that was great. Once I lost some weight, I was able to switch to a bootcamp class, which I love. I supplemented that with hiking on the weekends.

Then I added the diet. Really, track your food. Recording my food was/is invaluable for me. I was not eating enough protein for fat loss. And I actually thought nuts were a good source of protein. And buy a food scale.

Intermittent fasting is a great way to jumpstart everything. It didn’t work for me long term, due to my work schedule.

Consider meeting with a dietician to better learn which foods will help you get back to a normal state. You can likely get all your vitamins/minerals (micronutrients) from food without need of supplements.

14773,"First, I wanna say I feel for you. Life isn’t fair and I wish the world could function in a way that allowed everyone to have time to worry about themselves and actually provide themselves with proper self care. 
A few things come to mind. First, I want you to realize that fitness and getting in shape isn’t about being strong, or shredded, or huge. Fitness is about bettering yourself for the sake of your well being through physical activity. So by understanding that first, you can start to find what excites you. Whatever you do to stay active needs to be something you enjoy. Whether playing a sport, or doing a certain type of workout plan (that doesn’t hurt you of course) fitness once you start becomes something that you look forward to. I’m a college student personally and with my busy schedule, getting to the gym is often a highlight of my day. Simply getting to be active and not being stuck in a class room is what brightens my day. So I believe to find your motivation you need to find what excites you, what thrills you so much that you can’t get it out of your head because you wanna go do it so bad? Find what excites you and you’ll never wanna quit. As well going back to what could benefit you. I imagine as a programmer you are likely mentally exhausted at the end of a day ( just an assumption) by that point I understand not having the will to get it something done. But for a life style that you’re describing, I don’t believe you need something huge. There’s no need for a fancy program (no pun intended) to help you get in shape; especially when you have lower back pain. I think you need something that allows you to to not have to think while you’re doing it and allows you to actively relax and counteract all the work you do in your head all day. I would suggest just to start walking. Go out take 20-30 minutes everyday out of your 6 hour gap that you’re describing and just walk my friend. Walking, relaxing, and clearing you mind I think could do wonders for you physical and mental health. Hope this is helpful best of luck to you!",0
14774,"Working out shouldn’t be an individualizing and targeting thing is n my opinion so I would suggest first looking for exercises that work your whole body. But truly the basics work the best. Body weight exercises are amazing for muscle and strength development. Exercises such as: Push ups, pull ups, squats, and lunges. Those 4 exercises alone could be manipulated and adjusted and be someone’s year round program. For core there are literally so many body weight exercises you could do so I would go to YouTube to watch people preform certain exercises but truly very few core exercises are that bad. If you’re a complete beginner I would say try working out with those 4 listed exercises 2-3 times a week (but you could work up to doing almost daily core work) Finally diet. Start to transition your mindset to looking at what you eat as fuel and understanding how good foods and bad foods will affect your body. If your problem is you struggle to gain weight then you’re likely an under eater, or you’re not consuming a lot of nutritious food, or both. No matter the case it’s alright. Just simply start looking into thing like the grams of protein in everything you eat and aim for say 60-90g a day to start and see how your body responds to that. Then you can look into other sources of nutrition and see how they personally affect your body and over time you will find what works best for you. Hope this is helpful and good luck!",0

I dont mind answering here, it might help others also!! 

1. Are you athletic, fit, sedentary, overweight, or obese?
*I'm 5'4 and 210lbs. People guess I'm 160 and say I carry my weight nicely. I average between 5000 and 14000 steps a day. I'm trying to get back to working out- walking 3 to 5 miles a day. I'm just too tired to do it. 

2. How many calories do you consume on a daily basis? Do you know how many of each macronutrient you are getting (carbs, fats, protein)? 
*I have no idea. I eat salads mainly. Not fast food salads I make them myself from the bags at grocery store and add my own veggies. I dont count calories but i have cut out sugar and sodas. 

3. Has the amount of calories increase, decreased, or stayed the same since starting your new job? 
*It has decreased with fast food bc I cant leave for lunch as much as I used to. So I bring my lunch in and it's mostly salads (I make) bc it's easy to have for lunch. And I end up eating another salad when I get home bc it's easy and convenient. And I love salads. 

4. How many meals/snacks throughout your day include sugar?
*No snacks I dont have time and I dont eat after 7pm I do drink lots of water. Half my weight in oz.  

5. Do you get enough sleep at night?
*I sleep maybe 4-5 hours. No matter what time I fall asleep (or set an alarm) I will only sleep 4-5 hours. When I nap I set my alrms for 30mins to and hour and sometimes I sleep through it. I did get some vitamins that helps with sleeping. 

Potential causes of less energy: Crashes from sugar, especially if not consuming many calories during the day. Not getting enough sleep OR getting too much sleep. Increased stress levels. 

Are we hitting any sweet spots with this?
*I think I'm not eating enough (healthy) food during the day but I honestly dont have time. I literally have to make myself (and everyone in my area) understand that I need to eat. Sometimes I go to my car and eat so I can actually eat and in peace.  And I really needed vitamins. I got B12 and hoping it will help",0

I’ve been doing a lot more cardio recently too for concerns about my heart health and have found that hydration is a big thing. My HR can quickly get above 160 without enough water from jogging. (Max should be 157 for me). I’ve found with proper hydration it sits more around 145 max. But I’d definitely seek a cardiologist like you have and maybe an EP specialist.

Depends on the time period, I've experimented with a lot of varied lifestyle options; I'm picky about my food quality, as many have particular avenues into health issues if not careful. Grass fed beef is expensive, so I don't eat that much of it; usually constrained to a bulk pack of hamburger frozen and cheap, for the old gbeef and rice. There's no way I could afford to get most of my protein from red meat though, eggs and whey are probably my mains along with the rice and pea protein.  


Pretty easy to find out for yourself; try a small amount of each thing individually and see what effects you notice.

A-AKG, multiple creatines, beta alanine, BCAAs were probably the main effective ingredients, but it's really difficult to separate out internally which ingredient was doing what, subjectively, aside from the beta alanine itchy flush heh but that's a pretty clear indicator.

The number of dodgy trainers out there is astonishing, the ease of entry into the profession is absurd, and the accessibility of fitness information is probably at an all time high. With all that in mind, it’s no wonder people think they understand what’s going on, and think they don’t need us. Hell, sometimes I struggle to understand our role in the gym!

Like you mentioned, part of our job is selling our services, and this is what we need to do. People need to understand they don’t have all the answers, and they need to accept that sometimes they need help, especially if they aren’t moving towards their goals, as you mentioned. To do that, we need to improve our profession. We need to keep educating ourselves and others, keep being patient with people who are working to change themselves, and keep trying to elevate the world’s perception of our profession. 

Personal training is a people game, we need to be able to approach people with respect and show them how we can help.

14927,"Strong foundation is king. I would suggest starting by working on upper body strength by doing push-ups (in strict form). 

Then work on your core by doing L-sit holds. you can have a look on YT via channels like AbnormalBeings and CalisthenicMovement on the type of progressions you can do to work towards the L-sit (if you can’t do them).

For the planche, this is quite an intensive skill so take your time working up to this. Have a look here on the type of progressions you can start with: https://youtu.be/UZ-1jwG7aQ4

Practice these exercises and importantly, don’t rush! Take your time with these exercises and trust me, it will pay off in the long run.

14967,"Was looking for reviews on this machine but here’s my quick take. I bought the Pro-Form HIIT H7 elliptical machine from Costco. Think they have sold out at least at my nearby Costco and I no longer seem them listed on the Costco website. 

Putting it together was fairly easy but requires two people because the center flywheel component is quite heavy. Took me several hours but honest could have been done within 3-4 hours had I focused only on putting it together. I was also doing other things that day. 

The machine included a year subscription iFit. I have not activated the code yet. It’s touchscreen. The performance of the touchscreen is pretty zippy from one setting page to another. Takes about a minute to load the software when you first boot up. The company recommends to unplug the machine when not in use. 

The stepper is pretty deep up and down so 5’ tall to 6’ tall folks should have no problems getting a workout with comfort. I had and old elliptical that was really short and felt horrible stepping up and down. There is a built-in fan, adjustable fan speed.  It isn’t the quietest fan but not annoyingly loud. I can see maybe the bearing could wear out one day and then I’m not sure how to get into it to replace the fan. Fan is part of the housing for the LCD computer screen. 

The resistance has a nice range, 24 is max, which is comparable to what you would find on an elliptical machine at the gym. 

It’s a great (so far) compact machine so far. Takes up a really small foot print. I have been using it for about a month every day. Because I have not yet activated iFit, there are many custom maps and training guide that are locked. That being said, there several maps (occasional new maps) that are free to use. Obviously you can configure the activity for manual settings too, like any normal machine. 

I have not had any issues with the stability of the machine. Granted, it sits on carpet so that helps. If there are issues with any wobble, the legs have adjustable screw stabilizers to balance it on hard floor. 

Pro-Form, the brand, in general seems to be ok. This is not my first Pro-Form, but my previous Pro-Form elliptical was old and cheap...$150 cheap, so you really get what you pay for. This new HIIT H7 was almost $1000. 

I’ve heard of reviews where people sweat and drip on top of the stepper bars. This supposedly caused rust and even voided one person’s warranty. I haven’t dropped sweat on the machine yet so can’t vouch for that claim. The stepper bars (connecting to the inner flywheel part of the machine) is painted with thick solid black paint so I’m not sure how it would rust. Maybe it was rusted further inside...? 

The machine from my experience so far is solid. No creaking noise or wobble. If you step fast and hard enough it will sway side to side, but that’s the extreme case so far when I tried to push it hard on purpose. 

It’s a recommended product from me so far. I’ll let you know if customer service sucks or if it falls to pieces in another month. Haha.",0

Eventually it becomes old hand; don’t be bitter about it, or rationalize it like “I have to make time to go to the gym.” Treat it like sleep: You don’t wake up every morning thinking, “I can’t wait to sleep tonight.” You know that one way or another, by this time tomorrow, you will have slept. Treat the gym the same way at first. Mentally, you’ve already committed to finishing the workout. Now your body just needs to catch up with your head.

This belief does have a truth in it though. At the ends of your bones are growth plates. In young kids these areas of bone are “softer” than the shaft of the bones. If you do high impact exercises such as a depth jump though, these repetitive high impacts could injure your growth plates which could affect your height. So don’t do exercise such as depth jumps from like 3-4 feet high.

15056,"Once your body is familiar with the exercises you are doing, consider changing the your set/rep scheme. If you're just beginning, you're probably doing something along the lines of -- 3 sets / 10 reps w/ a minute or so rest inbetween. 

Every 6-8 weeks change it up and let your body continue to adapt to something new. 

Ex. Increase the amount of reps you do at a certain weight. 3 sets / 12 reps

Ex. Increase the weight you are doing. Your reps may go down and you'll need more rest time between sets. 3 sets / 10-8-6 reps

Eventually you will increase the amount of sets (up to 6 or 8), but it's normal to keep it around 3 or 4 for a few months.

More reps typically means more muscle tearing = muscle growth

More weight means stronger/tighter muscles.

Remember: Getting stronger (always going heavy) will result in tighter muscles. STRETCH AFTER EVERY WORKOUT. Muscle takes awhile to grow. Treat your body with good food, enough protein, healthy carbs, phenomenal sleep, water, and keeping your stress levels down. In 3 years you will look back and it'll feel really nice putting in this hard work. Keep at it.",0

15059,You’re not losing weight but you’re only eating a 1000 calories??? How much do you weigh? How active are you currently? How do you know it’s ~1000 calories? 95-99% of people would not be able to sustain this low of calories without already being really lean or worse,0
15060,"Male or female? Age...weight...help us a little here.  At 1,000 calories you're most likely already at a large calorie deficit and will lose weight with zero exercise.",0

• ab roller
• 8KG hex dumbbells
• barbell and curled barbell
• 16KG and 32KG kettlebells (mainly used for weighted pull-up and dip bars)
• foam roller

Always good to mix them up to make training interesting, especially when training at home! Invest in good quality equipment and they’ll last 👍",0

15084,"I was doing some follow along YouTube videos of core exercises. This included leg raises, inverted crunches, bicycle crunches, and something that involved me putting my legs in a v-shape in the air while laying down and then trying to touch my toes.

I am also incredibly inflexible.",0
15085,Thanks for sharing! Guess I'll take one day at a time and increase my frequency of core workouts.,0
15086,Ha. Thanks for the tip.  🤓,0
15087,"Definitely sounds like weakness. I’ve always had a truly garbage core and all the fun that comes with one (back pain, weak lifts from no bracing, rib flare). Always hated core exercise because of it. 

About 6 weeks ago I started hitting core hard, minimum 4x week, usually more. Minimum 5 sets of whatever exercises I felt like doing. Mix of planks/side planks, reverse crunches, lying knee raises, hanging leg raises, and Russian twists. I can say it DOES get easier. 

I was so weak I built up some muscle fast. I still can’t roll out for the life of me, even on my knees, but I’m working on it. I can do more reps and longer times of all the above exercises. Plus I actually have some visible muscle there now, just trying to lean out some more so it’ll pop.",0
15088,Well if took 1000 how much should I burn by exercising?,0
15089,"Nice bro just had a quick look and fuck , very strong and your skill work is awesome",0
15090,Very clean!!,0
15091,"What OP is demonstrating is very advanced-- it's def worthwhile in the long run to work on connecting to your deep core first, before testing its ability to stabilize a really extreme load.

A good starting deep core exercise would be the ""dead bug"". There are different variations of it that you can try to suit your level, but the rules are the same-- keep your belly drawing in (you shouldn't see your stomach pushing out when you do this; for some people, pressing their low back into the floor can help with this), and don't let your hips wiggle/shift.

It is VERY common for people to not have much core strength/control!",0
15092,Cool. Mine is @rstless,0
15093,If your Instagram hit me up buddy be good to connect on there too. Search for lee downing-keat,0
15094,"Yeah man. There’s no limits. I think it also comes down to what you’re aiming towards and what you’re goal is. If you’re talking pound-for-pound in strength, bodyweight training is pretty much up there. It’s true that despite its growing community worldwide, to the normal eye, not many people know what calisthenics is. 

Saying that, calisthenics teaches you a lot of the anatomy and technicality of the human body. We talk about scapula activation a lot (probably 90% of the time 😂) but the science on how each static movement is achieved by activating which muscle group will always amaze me. 

Calisthenics does bring the community together and based on my experience, it’s always nice to meet people and help each other progress. I particularly get this either when I’m at the park or messages on Instagram.

Like I said, the cali community is full of people of different levels and continues to inspire me.",0
15095,"I’m a PT. Just for perspective, this is a very, very advanced core stability exercise. It’s well done here. 95% of us aren’t strong enough to do it. Get good at various planks and then maybe try this.",0
15096,Think we are like minded in that aspect and most of that is why I do and love Calisthenics . Been reading a book that has blown my mind on how far you can go with Calisthenics and all the different progressions you can do. It’s what inspired me to make a video and reasons to get into Calisthenics and why I moved my channel into mainly focusing on it. It’s a great way to train and still even now not a lot of people do it and many don’t know much about it and how to train.,0
15097,"It’s the main type of training I do since I mainly train at home (or park occasionally).

Beauty of it is that I train whenever I like without much equipment, train in the comfort of my own home and I just appreciate how ‘organic’ it is. Mastering ones bodyweight especially doing ‘gravity defying’ exercises like the human flag, planche, lever etc to dynamics like muscle-ups, pull-up and push-up variations is just amazing. 

There are always progressions and loads of ways to improve the exercises, even combining a mix of static and dynamics together. With calisthenics, there isn’t any limits. You continue to work your way up. Doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or advanced, there’s always something that can be progressed.

Plus, I see calisthenics like an adult playground. Seeing pull-up bars, dip bars etc in a park always gets me hyped up haha! 

Overall, calisthenics is something I can always fall back on no matter where I am and it’s a huge part of my life. Think that pretty much sums it up!",0
15098,"It can take time to get used to but it depends on the type of exercise, whether your doing a dynamic (e.g. ab rollout) or static (e.g. plank). What type of exercises are you doing?",0
15099,"You can do it on any type of floor. If you’re doing knee rollouts, put a mat or towel underneath so it doesn’t hurt your knees. If you do it on a mat (like it video) or on carpet, it’s more challenging. On a smoother surface, it is easier.

If you’re just starting out, rollout against a wall to see how far you can rollout to. It also stops you from falling on your face.",0
15100,"Haha, you can do this against a wall to stop you falling. Roll out and see how far you can go and position yourself accordingly. Give it a try (when you’re up for it!)",0
15101,"Great list. Thank you. 

Anything for arms and legs for fragile people?",0
15102,Try looking through this [List](https://www.whyiexercise.com/back-strengthening-exercises.html),0
15103,I appreciate your kindness!,0
15104,"My core is trash. Tried to do core exercises for the first time in many moons true other day. After 3-5 minutes I am convulsing from extremely painful core cramps/spasms. 

Is this general weakness/lack of conditioning? Or do we need more stretching and lighter ab work to build up to it?",0
15105,"Yes that’s basically it. It’s far easier for you to move around the rings. With this when I taught a friend as you pull just think pull and roll over , keep elbows tight to body and imagine running your hands from high to your chest and follow your rip cage to your sides and at the same time throw yourself over . I working on slowing it down and being able to focus on just keeping the rings tight and not having to just throw body over the rings . Yes Ring dip compared to the parallel is a beast. But to me it’s better not because it will make your stronger but because you have more flexibility is getting it right for you. You can always adjust the straps to get the right with for you. Some parallels bars are either too wide or too narrow. With rings you have 100% flexibility",0
15106,Well said buddy,0
15107,What he said below. Form is king. This if you have weak wrists can be hard on them but if you strengthen them over time they can take it. Without the false grip this exercise becomes so much more difficult so it’s something to try.,0
15108,Awesome . How you getting on with it and what do you like about Calisthenics,0
15109,Eating less.  Period.,0
15110,Sounds like parasthesia. I would recommend getting your neck checked out by a professional.,0
15111,Are you supposed to do this on carpet so it's harder to move and requires more effort? Or tile/frictionless place so it slides easier and harder to control?,0
15112,Oh yea i tried this once. Fell on my face.,0
15113,Does anyone know where that literature is?,0
15114,When I’m in a gym I do barbell,0
15115,It depends on how much you take a day,0
15116,Just do cardio and use weights to build muscle,0
15117,"Yeah, it’s great bro. Lemme ask you this though; you tried barbell rollouts? They are really nice👌🏾",0
15118,It just means that you are getting a pump in your triceps,0
15119,I do 🙋‍♂️,0
15120,"It’s not a dumb question. Safety and injury prevention are extremely important. Movements like this may perhaps be terrible for weak wrists, but having proper strength/mechanics through any joint will keep the forces applied in the proper directions.

This is why technique and form are so important during lifts (and any exertion, really). Take the low-back for example. Lift heavy weights with poor posture and you’re basically asking for injury. Lift with proper form and you can do some impressive shit. 

Tons of people fuck their shit up by jerking around car seats while hunched over in the back of a mini-van. It’s not necessarily the movement or exercise that’s terrible for the joints, it’s bad form or the inability to maintain good form (weakness/fatigue) that is bad for your joints.",0
15121,Sorry if this is a dumb question...but that has to be terrible for your wrists?,0
15122,"which is the craziest part. I don't know how it works exactly, I'm assuming its cause of how the body can easily move around with rings maybe? But rings look alot scarier than they end up being.

ring dips on the other hand are a different beast lol",0
15123,"Deadlifts are best barefoot really . Squats can be the same depending on your ankle mobility. I used to have squat shoes for squatting ( obviously) and would use vibram five finger shoes for deadlifts , barefoot with grip",0
15124,"Sorry, can't stop won't stop. So get over it little boy.",0
15125,Yes it is. That’s why I like about Calisthenics though is there are so many goals you can strive for and each are individual to each person . I can do handstand push ups well but would love to do a freestanding one,0
15126,Being able to do an Iron Cross is a personal goal of mine. I hear it’s a real test of strength.,0
15127,"It depends on the app but most have their own database containing the exercise and number of calories burned per hour. These are presumably based on scientific literature but in the case of MyFitnessPal it's not very transparent. 
You have to watch out for the caloric estimates of food too, because many are user-generated and can be inaccurate.",0
15128,Buy yourself a pair. Cheap nowadays . Make sure to get numbered though as it’s a pain levelling them up and wooden feel better,0
15129,Gotta find a gym with those rings in it.  Right now its just pull ups/dips/leg raises on the 3 in 1,0

15175,"Oh, please don't apologize! Id highly recommend a set of resistance bands. Ones that you can attach handles or have the handles already on it. On Amazon you can find sets for about $20. Body weight workouts are great as well especially getting back into the swing of things. The resistance bands will come in handy once your body gets used to the swing of things and add some variation. There's a really good resource on YouTube from the  UCLA department that provides instructions on how to squat, lunge and everything. 

I tried linking it below. Let me know if it works for you!

15178,"Sorry for the late reply, I don’t have any equipment but I was a frequent runner/tennis player, so cardio workouts are what I’m used to. No equipment, but I’m definitely willing to buy some if you have any reasonable recommendations!",0
15179,"I do 3 full body workouts per week with the same lineup of exercises as yours except I don’t put in the pushups. Recovery days from this routine is needed. I change up this routine by using variations for each movement so my workout is different each time during the week. (Squat variations - sumo, goblet, lunges, etc). Do the same for the other movements. Then I either repeat this 3 day setup the next week or add even more variations to get 6 different workouts. I then do a 15 minute jump rope or battle ropes or slam ball routine on my off days. I usually take at least 2 days off each week. Full body gives you a lot of volume so think of it as a total for a week. Don’t go too heavy and every once in awhile switch up your reps maybe going 6-8 one week and 8-10 or 10-12 the next. You can also play with the sets for each exercise and do each as a set, supersets or circuits. Also keeps you from getting bored. If you do push pull legs or other split types you can gone more days since you aren’t working everything every time. Full body works best for me because my schedule is unpredictable. So if I miss a day I haven’t wrecked my split since it’s always full body. 

Finally, if their is an accessory exercise you want to focus on, like biceps or triceps, you can add that but again be mindful of the overall volume you are adding. The exercises you have listed are compound movements so a lot is already going on. 

When I have veered away for awhile I go with ppl. Good luck.",0
15180,happy to know,0
15181,It would help if you posted a form video! Not sure if it is allowed here but would help us get an idea as to what may be going on. Form for squats can be very different from person to person. Not everyone will feel good with the traditional cuing for squats so it is a matter of determining which form would work best for your body type!,0
15182,"I'm so proud of you for getting this far in recovery. Just some advice from someone who's also been through similar stuff, if particular exercises was part of your ed, maybe try avoiding that type of exercise and choose something else that won't remind you of that time or make you feel like your planning out your exercise time in a similar way to how you did when you were sick. When I was at my worst, I would force myself to run pretty much everywhere, including up every flight of stairs and on the spot in public bathroom cubicles. When I first tried introducing exercise into recovery, I tried using treadmills and ellipticals and it was just too easy to get obsessive because it felt like the same as it was before. I switched to weight training and rowing machines and exercise bikes for cardio, and that was enough to make it feel like a new, separate thing from my disordered behaviours.",0

Don’t pester him about it, but keep suggesting healthier options and habits!",0
15211,"To apply the principle of progressive overload you would need to make each exercise more difficult for yourself. This can be done a handful of ways: increasing the weights, the reps or decreasing the rest time or adding super sets. As well as making sure the concentric action (muscle shortening) is faster than the eccentric part (muscle lengthening).

I’d also suggest adding low to moderate intensity steady state cardio for the calorie burning and heart benefits. You could aim for 10km.

You could also add 100 pushups and sit ups",0

I never added any weights. I also switched back and forth every day between pushing through my heels, and pushing through my whole foot. So you could switch things up by varying your squats that way. You could switch back and forth between squats and lunges or deadlifts. Just an idea. :)",0

A good rule of thumb (not insofar as “bro science,” but a generalization. If someone wants a citation I’d be happy to find one.) is that cardio encourages weight loss, while resistance training encourages fat loss. This is, of course, assuming you are eating in an appropriate caloric deficit while meeting your nutritional macros. (There are lots of free calculators online to help you get started with this!)

Also, personally I would avoid using BMI in favour of BFP, as it can help paint a better mental image of how far you have progressed in your head.

Tl;dr: If you are worried about being “skinny fat”, you want try and remove excess fat while promoting muscle growth to round out the look. Resistance/weight training is what you ought to be looking at.",0

15383,"1) I never said you look worse than me, bringing up irrelevant info and avoiding the actual topic of discussion (your form) shows you cannot argue the facts we pointed out.

2) Just to be clear you partial repped EVERY SINGLE LIFT in your video, except the leg and knee raises. Your height or arm length has nothing to do with partial reps, it is all about the angle. Are you hitting 90*, Ray Charles could see you weren’t. On a side note it looks like you need to stretch your back, hamstrings, and calves from the way those leg raises looked.

3) Height does not change wether or not someone has good form or not.

4) You are correct that some people have more/less ROM. You never mentioned any thing like “had surgery or something, getting my strength and ROM back” so the average person is going to assume your a normal healthy individual.

5) once your form starts to go it’s time to move on to the next exercise. Once you can only get those partial reps you can rest and drop the weights (when applicable) or you can rest longer. After you lose ~10% of your strength it’s time to go to another exercise involving a different set of muscles.

6) I think you need to work on being able to handle criticism. Everyone has things they can work to improve on yours happens to be form and your character could use some work too bud.",0

15401,What is Calisthenics?,0
15402,"Lots of different ways to go about it. If you start stalling then:

Add some weight to your pushups.
Do a set fast and then a set slow. 
Clapping pushups 
Do 70 push ups even if you have to start doing them in sets of 1 or 2. Rest multiple days and retry. 
Add some pushups to you total each day and then at fail go back to a starting number. Ex. Day 1 30pushups, day 2 32pushups, day 3 34 ..day 6 40pushups day 7 fail, day 8 32 pushups). 

Not sure what will work for you. Also working on your isolation exercises could help. Core wavering? Take a break from pushups, do some ab work. Triceps the weak link? Pectorals? Exercise those muscles and come back to the pushup.",0
15403,"Depends on your goals. It's a decent workout, but I wouldn't use renegade rows purely for back because the range of motion is slightly limited. If you just want to fit, lean and healthy then I'd do goblet squats, rows, dumbbell deadlift, chest presses, overhead press. Hitting big muscles will burn more calories, more so if you do it circuit style, and you will still work your biceps with the rows and triceps with the chest press. Your core should get a blasting stabilising.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe do renegade rows (you essentially doubled up your planks) and swings as a full body/cardio finisher?",0

15407,"Lol! I took a cheap shot? I asked a question. You had to be a sensitive fuck because you know your reps are bullshit. You’re just trying to impress people who don’t know any better. 
I was a fat fuck a couple years ago and got skinny. You think I’m insulted by that? I’m not nearly as sensitive as you are. I’m working out correctly, full range of motion because I’m not half-ass bitch. 

But hey man, if posting daily videos of your quarter reps is what it takes to get your jollies off. You do you princess. Sorry I offended you.",0
15408,Clown,0
15409,"Above all else, make sure you stay consistent. I'd recommend not overdoing it early on especially since you're just getting back into it! Good luck!",0

15412,"I. Look. Better. Than. The. Both. Of. You. Nobody partial reps body weight GTFOH.  Where do you see  1/4 range of motion?  You dont know my height or arm length.  You dudes are just thirsty to bestow wisdom that you dont actually have.  ROM isnt universal.  A 5'4"" guy and a 6'4"" wont perform a rep the exact same way.  Never mind injury history or fatigue (beginning of a work out vs. the end).  Go impress your gym bros with your ""knowledge"" or ""expertise"" - not me.  Im here to have fun, im not looking for your support ""big guy.""",0
15413,"I won’t argue with you on locking out. But what you’re doing is way beyond “not locking out”. You’re doing quarter reps for just about all your motions. 

I tried to be reasonable with my question. Even specifically said that you’re obviously in good shape. I figured that was ok because most people in here are fairly reasonable. I apologize for assuming you were reasonable as well. Apparently you’re more of the arrogant gym douchebag type. Enjoy your bullshit reps.",0
15414,"Damn. I thought this was a dude that needed motivation. That sucks, my bad lol.",0

15418,yup i have gloves and handwraps thank you anyways❤️,0
15419,$,0
15420,"I cannot for the life of me understand the partial reps. 
You’re in great shape, but your ROM is consistently 1/4 of what I typically do.",0
15421,Thanks a lot,0
15422,I will. Thanks for the tip,0
15423,Look into Jim Stoppanis programs. He’s a legend and mainly about healthy lifting and healthy gains. Or just cycle thru liftvault.com and see what you like,0

15425,I might be able to do an hour or so.,0

Do you also not let you food be scanned by lasers on the till 😂",0
15430,Okay then- I'm ordering a geiger counter with my walmart credit card today and I am going to test organic vs nonorganic radiation of various foods then. Don't know if the geiger counter will put it up but I will try.,0
15431,Because organic food definitely hasn't got any pollutants or anything else on it either 😂,0
15432,When you eat while gaining weight that food will stay with you for months or years- so just make sure it is the healthiest stuff you can find.,0
15433,Amen,0
15434,Not long til the old 6 pack! Keep working!,0
15435,"You’re at 35/40 so I’d say do 40 first thing in the morning. Then after you get dressed and whatnot and you’re about to go to school, do 40. Then at lunch do 40. Then come home and do 40. Then do some homework or whatever you do when you get home and do 40 and do 40 before you go to sleep. You might not be able to do 40 each time but you need progressive overload to get better. Eat protein and get sleep and stay consistent. Soon you’ll be itching to do push ups and your number will go up. Alternatively, weighted push ups are a way to increase the number without doing a bunch of push ups a day",0
15436,Unrelated side-note: Never ever use the bag without handwraps and gloves.,0
15437,do one more pushups on average a day and youll have it done in a month and a half.,0

15462,Thx. Stretching is definitely something I tend to overlook,0
15463,Don’t do that much at all maybe? Too much if one exercise is bad and only doing one exercise is also bad,0
15464,No this is not how you get in shape if that’s your plan all this is doing is the same exercise for a couple days and karma whoring,0

15498,"Spot fat reduction is not possible through exercise. To lose weight you need to be in a caloric deficit.

So you could do low intensity steady state cardio. Walking on an incline or using a stair stepper is great. Riding a bike (not a stationary one). Swimming is also an option, there are a lot of ways to do cardio.",0
15499,"What you say about consistency is so true. This is why I took photos when I first started and when I don’t want to exercise, I look at these!",0
15500,Thanks bro 👊,0
15502,Move your head in all directions and use your hand to resist and push back against it.  Working on trapezius would also make that area look bigger.  Google these exercises if you are not familiar with what to do.  https://youtu.be/cYPDveEb1RQ,0

15517,Literally no one cares what you have to say. Just stop trying to insult me. It's really sad.,0
15518,It happens to me too. I think it's some sort of shock/spasm because the body isn't used to it. I will go away after a few sessions.,0
15519,Damn I’m 17 myself. Any tips for a guy who needs to study a lot and can only do bodyweight exercises?,0

15524,Actually i wasnt on any suppliments for the past 2 years....After that ..my trainer told me to take a mass gainer for bulking ...So I just take a gainer...And its results were insane...It helps me to bulk up but not to gain muscle mass,0
15525,"I would look into plans by natural bodybuilders about diets and routines unless your going the ""supplement"" route either way hope you succeed",0

15527,15kg in 45 is a lot unless your taking PEDs your not going to build a lot of muscle in such a short time. Are you bulking for a competition?,0

15529,"yea, eating healthy can absolutely help your health and fitness, even if your weight stays constant",0
15530,"Oh. Oh! I think I got that down then. I mean, I eat average but its unhealthy. I'm sorry I love pringles and chicken sandwiches too much, I cant eat a salad. 

I probably need to eat healthier though cause theres more to food than just calories...",0
15531,"no, to gain stamina just exercise regularly and your stamina will gradually improve. i meant eat more food so as to not lose weight with the increased exercise",0
15532,"So I was out of breath, heart pounding, chest hurting...cause I didn't eat? 

I forgot weather or not I ate it not haha.",0

Speaking for myself (a big guy that can/does lift heavy on the regular) ... a newer peep showing up and doing the right amount of work *for them*, and then keeps showing up earns mad respect. Don’t gym-intimidate yourself - pick your goal, follow it with a sane plan that works for you, and all will be well.

I've shown these comments to my friends who have congratulated me and howled I'm laughter at the sheer audacity and inconsideration of some of the comments. I wasn't expecting so much backlash over a seemingly harmless post of my successful efforts. I've gained 6kg, sitting at 11% body fat. I worked my arse off for what I've managed to accomplish, I wasn't expecting such ridicule and disrespect from the lifting community. We're supposed to be brothers united by iron. If there was any evidence backed up by the allegations I'd be less pissed off but there's nothing that indicates steroid use apart from people's misjudgement of what's accomplishable with the right mindset",0

15649,"I’d suggest lifting weights instead of straight cardio and only doing 3 days a week. 1200 calories is pretty low and not really sustainable in the long run. I lost over 50 pounds and saw the biggest difference with the following: 
1. Intermittent fasting 16:8 
2. Made sure my protein goals were met
3. Ate 1800-1900 calories 
4. Lifted heavy 
 
Also, with your chocolate craving, look into drizzlicious! It helps with the craving and super yummy! 

Good luck 💪🏼💪🏼",0

But personally I average about 300 calories a day in cardio, 1400 food calories (because im a sucker for chocolate), and I also try to fit in strength exercises whenever I get the chance. A month in and so far I feel amazing and I am starting to notice a difference in how my body looks (trying not to go by weight lost but fat lost instead). Good luck to you!",0

15655,"I took up fasting and started crashing after a few weeks of under eating.  I eat around 2000 calories a day, sometimes more.  I still crash hard and have to get a surplus going.  However, over the years I learned I can get into shape in a few weeks.  I just fluctuate in water water and am quite lean underneath.  Staying in good shape is hard as I start crashing, so I have yet to fast and stay active daily.  It's hard to fit 3.5-4k in one to two meals without liquid nutrients.  Liquid nutrients wasn't working for me, I perform better eating whole foods over liquids as well.

15659,"1,300 calories is the absolute lowest recommended for a female before you could run into malnutrition problems among other things if given enough time of a low calorie diet.

My recommendation is to eat 1,600-1,800. And weigh yourself each week to see if you are losing or gaining. 

It also depends on how much you exercise. Low intensity steady state cardio is the best for burning calories. If you do more cardio you can eat more, the less cardio you do the less you can eat and still lose weight.

MyFitnessPal is a great way to get a decent estimate of your caloric intake. Low calorie, high volume foods are great for feeling full and getting micronutrients (vegetables &amp; fruits). Protein is a good calorie source for feeling full as well. Just a heads up a stereotypical healthy food might be high in calories so it makes it harder to diet because you cannot eat as much of it for the same amount of calories as something else. I referring to things like avocado, peanut butter, hummus, flaxseed. They are good for you but there are calorically dense compared to spinach, tomato, strawberries, etc.",0

It’s mostly fruit and veg, some lean proteins. Very easy to follow if you get your head around what’s cut and what you can have. I used to go to slimming world class, but once I got into a good routine I do it on my own- more a mindset change than I diet- if it’s food I know isn’t on the list I talk myself out of it! Keep going!",0
15666,Don't eat less than 1200 calories or your body goes into starvation mode.. So that will cause your body to hold onto fat instead of burn it,0
15667,thank you!!,0
15668,Look up what for example 1500 calories could look like in healthy food. That's a huge amount of food you'd never expect from such a 'small' number of calories. You stay full und happy and don't crave anymore. It's more about what you eat and less how much you eat. But of course there's always a 'too much' at a certain point.,0

15677,Honestly work into working out. Jumping strait into hardcore diet and exercise without proper steps will burn you out and cause more damage. Work up to more high intensity. Stay cutting one food at time like starting with soda. Find workout partner for moving and keeping you motivated. Think of it as a step program. One step at a time tell you reach your goals. I looked at your photos you are pretty hot 😍 just find what works best for you,0
15679,The BEST exercise. Fork put-downs.,0
15680,What I did for myself was focused on quality and didn’t worry much about quantity. Eliminating as much sugar as possible will help the most. Then eating as much leafy greens and vegetables as you can handle should make a significant difference. This is just an easier way of thinking about dieting in my opinion. How it helps,0
15681,Longevity sports such as biking or swimming. Something we're yer heartbeat is elevated a long time. Classes with intensity at gym can be good to,0

You have on your body the more fat you can lose. On top of using the treadmill incorporate some body weight exercises. Pushups, body squats, lunges ,push ups &amp; step ups into a chair or box bare all a good addition. Also If you continue to change what you are doing your body cannot get used to it. This will drive a plateau. As all the others have stayed in the thread diet is a major component to achieving success with weight loss. The best thing if all is to stay consistent and you will see the changes you are after. Good luck!",0

15696,"Jumping lunges are worse, you basically do a lunge then when you're on the standing up stage you jump up and switch legs into another lunge.

Now I’m working out for a couple hours a day and track everything I eat ( except when I go off rail and binge ). I love the way I fell and what I’m able to do now. If you check out obese to beast’s older videos he has good information for simple weight loss. For basic at home workouts I used hasfit off YouTube. The biggest thing to remember is take it one day at a time your going to have good and bad days. Also use YouTube and the forums here and educate yourself on proper nutrition and living a healthy lifestyle ( great time to do this is when using your bike for cardio ).",0

That said, exercise can certainly help you increase that deficit and of course is good for overall health. Nothing wrong with using the tread mill at all for that purpose!",0
15704,"The most effective way would be to do high intensity intervals. Like run or jog at a pretty high intensity for let’s say 1m then walk for 30-45s. As you advance you can decrease the walking time to shorter time or even just stand on the sides for enough time to recover breathe a bit. The main goal is to keep you heart rate near 80% effort for a short time. ie- 15-30m total workout time. Doing some sort of strength training will decrease body fat, but not weight. I think it’s healthier mindset to not focus on weight and focus on improving overall fitness instead.

Hope this helps",0
15705,"Exercise, while important, doesn't burn as many calories as people think. Diet is more important for losing weight (though exercise helps).

Hopefully one day you can share your journey as I am in a battle to get in shape.",0
15820,"Headphones and a music app. I have specific playlists for running, weight lifting, yoga, etc and put them on when I'm doing that activity. That way I always have music I enjoy",0
15821,"Yup. Yesterday after work I was really tired but it was a super warm day out for February so I got on my bike and did 20 miles and felt SO much better than the guilt I would have felt if I'd just gone home and done nothing. Now I just have to get in the right mental space to do some indoor weight work (LOVE exercising outside, HATE exercising indoors).",0

I see a guy who worked hard to lose 80 pounds, and as a guy who lost 80 pounds myself from 2015 to 2017 I know that’s not an easy thing to do, so I’m sharing some words of encouragement. I think maybe you guys have me mixed up with someone or something else?",0

15826,Thanks !,0
15827,"This is a great improvement, congratulations! Three tips though. 

1: Keep your head locked against the seat. My head tends to come off too sometimes, but you absolutely should stack your spine in a straight line while doing leg presses.

2: Lower your feet slightly on the pad. This will help the movement become slightly more quad dominant rather than using your calves as well.

3: It’s not necessary, but try doing pause presses, where you slow down as you reach the bottom of the rep before going back up. It will make the movement more fluid and with greater time under tension it can recruit more muscle fibres. Don’t be afraid to lower the weight to improve form!

But congrats on the progress!",0

15835,Great job it’s amazing how much a little exercise and proper nutrition make you feel.,0
15836,"I didn’t go to the gym till I had lost 150lbs, I did it through walking and proper nutrition. Your nutrition is key for weight loss, you have to keep in mind it’s a mind shift in nutrition and not a diet. Diets end and proper nutrition shouldn’t as you will end up being back in the same position you are now.",0
15837,"I don’t know what’s better medically but I find I work out better fasted. Also to preface I’m not a power lifter and hardly ever lift in the 6-8 range, most of my lifts are in the 10-12 range as you will be weaker fasted.",0
15838,"A very good diet isn't enough, you need to have an exceptionally strict diet and exercise routine.

Abs are not a sign of health. How lean you are now is perfect for aesthetics. Just lift weights and eat a little more than usual. You'll develop more muscle.

Then, when you have that extra muscle you can try lean out more. A full physique will make the abs pop more.",0
15839,"Not sure if the correct answer, but.....

Intermittent fasting, while a great method of weightloss for some leaves me absolutely, disgustingly hungry.

Not while I'm fasted, no.. by my second meal I get so hungry that I just can't stop myself from eating anything and everything around me.

As for exercise, I find a good hardcore 30 minutes swinging a kettlebell around gives me a good healthy desire to chow down.

Now, if I mix these two methods. I have a hunger that would make Galactus the world butcher blush.",0

15841,Spent years trying to lift body builder style and my body just prefers yoga and body weight exercises. My shoulders and back are so much stronger than when I was doing the big four in the gym. It’s likely body specific and I may eventually go back to heavy lifting as well but starting out yoga should be great for anyone. Keeps me flexible and centered,0

15858,Ok thanks so much for info!!!,0
15859,"Yoga is excellent all round, people who don't do it may think it's just about wafting around and stretching but you can build serious strength through it. I've had sessions where the day after my arms have been so spaghetti-like that it's been a challenge to stir my coffee haha! You need to be careful with form as you can hurt yourself if you don't do things correctly but if you can't/don't want to go to a class, there are tonnes of videos on YouTube. 

Barre type workouts and pilates are effective too and also burn like f*** when you're doing them! They generally only use bodyweight so no equipment needed beyond something to hold to keep your balance sometimes. 

Personally I use and love FitOn for all my exercise nowadays - it's free and there are loads and loads of different workouts. There are Android and Apple apps or you can use the website",0
15860,Haha thanks man!!,0
15861,Love this! And you're not an idiot - I thought the same years ago! It's not a cure for everything crappy that can happen but my goodness does it make life better. Enjoy my friend 😊,0

15867,"You could use a chair, but it depends on how you carry it. If you use a single chair and carry it in front of you that would be closer to a static hold with your biceps. If you carry two chairs out to the side that would be an actual farmer carry this works your forearms and grip mainly. Both are good but you have to work all your muscles. Also you will eventually have to find some bigger weights, progressive overload and all.",0

15870,To who? Just pretend you’re in rocky you’ll be fine!,0
15871,No but it is gonna be odd tho,0
15872,Are your parents gonna judge you for exercising?,0
15873,Planks should be changed to something else. I know I'm way late to this thread but Planks aren't the best. Try getting into a standing press position with dumbbells and walk sideways while putting 1 foot beside the other. Make sure you stay in a straight line that way. You can choose to leave the Dumbbells in peak press position if you want it to be harder.,0
15874,Does a chair work?,0
15875,No. It is because I live with my parents so it will look kinda weird.,0
15876,There's nothing? A table? You can literally pick up anything and walk with it.,0

15883,For the triceps you can still lean against a table or wall cand preform close grip presses but i got nothing for biceps with zero equipment,0

You can lose 1lb-2lb of fat mass every week at a healthy pace without losing muscle and gain 1-2lbs every week of mass, .5 of which will probably be muscle. There’s no short cuts to this, not any that are sustainable anyways. 

You won’t look like a fitness model or bodybuilder in 2 months. If it took them years to get it it’ll take you the same amount of time too.",0

Keeping your ankle flexed, kick up and behind you with one leg. straighten your leg as you kick, ankle flexed, and kick as high as you can. You should feel it in your glute. I normally do three sets of 15 reps on each leg but you might need to start with less. As your glutes get stronger, you can keep your leg straight out behind you and bounce your straight leg up and down slightly a certain number of times at the end of each set.",0

Absolutely take a week off, make sure to eat 1gram of protein per pound of body weight each day to recover faster, sleep a lot, and I’d recommend trimming down these cardio sessions to no more than 4x’s a week.",0
15919,"Definitely get checked by a doc. If he/she says you're healthy enough to continue training:
1. A good general rule is not to increase your total mileage by more than 10% each week. Will help avoid overtraining. 
2. A mistake a lot of people make, particularly when they start running, is trying to push too hard for too far. There are two run workouts that really help. The first is to run long and slow. Not just slow, but sloooooooow. Like you could sing a song or carry on a conversation while you do it. The second is to run hard, like so hard that you cannot run more than 30 seconds at that pace. Then walk for 60 seconds and repeat. A lot of people try to hang out in this middle limbo where they run at like 80% effort for long distance. This is the least beneficial, particularly for beginners. 
I hope your doc clears you. Good luck and stick with it!",0

15927,"Yes, my physical therapist told me the same. I could also do the bike. I usually do full body workouts. Thanks for your input!",0
15928,"Sure--you're skinny.  Now, given that, you are still trying to figure how to not have a spare tire of fat, right?  It's pretty straightforward:

1. Stop ""working out.""  ""Working out"" is great in the sense that activity is good for you.  People who get off the couch live longer and that's great.  It won't change how much body fat you have around your waist.  
2. Learn to do strength work.  The most effective is weight training, but you could do bodyweight stuff, power yoga, pilates.  Then **train**: get stronger over time measuring how much work or weight you can move.
3. Combine this with aerobic or HIIT (concurrent training).  We have [abundant](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/52/3/161.full.pdf) [evidence](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2019/05000/Effects_of_12_Week_Concurrent_High_Intensity.34.aspx?casa_token=SNcNpON9mKQAAAAA:_92l1LeuCPuePvqVXlhFvDfkxiH-VY2TWzUDDZQABtvm7fRHAHCJOzMjk4QxB8dbvSLvAUX1POIJW3zlIPEwBkII) that [combining](https://scholars.direct/Articles/sports-medicine/aspm-1-010.php?jid=sports-medicine) strength and HIIT/aerobic means more fat mass loss.
4. Eat less crap.  You don't have to weigh your food.  Just cut out a cookie every day, or that second helping of &lt;whatever&gt;.  Maybe it's cutting out beer or sodas, idk.  You need to figure out what you are putting in your mouth, and cut out a couple hundred calories a day.  That is super simple.
5. You can look at your [macros](https://www.iifym.com/iifym-calculator/).  Again, this is not rocket science.  If you are getting 75% of your calories through carbs, maybe you need to put down that macaroni bowl and add in a serving or chicken or pork.",0

15930,"how heavy are the dumbells? You can do a lot with just those. You just need to work on progressive overload and as it'll be hard for you to increase the weight due to lack of equipment you need to increase the intensity sooo less rest ,more reps. Slower reps.  You can do squats, rows , overhead press , bicep curls , tricep extensions , ab work,  Just google ""exercises with dumbells for x body part"" and choose whatever you like. find sets and reps you are okay with as  a first time training and do more and more every time. So 3x10 squats, next time 3x12 , next time 3x15 etc. 3x20. 4x10, 4x13, 4x15. Just listen to your body. Push yourself but no need to do it until you fall on the ground. if you want to lose fat you need to be at a caloric deficit.",0

I have a lot of issues with really tight muscles. Adding in doing stretching daily, even just 10 minutes, is crucial for me to be able to workout (or just function in general really). 

Foam rolling adds another level to that. It can be painful and really uncomfortable but also very much worth it.",0

15941,"You really don't need direct lower back work. If deadlifts bother you, I'd still work in a variation like sumo that takes a bit of stress off or decrease the load (maybe even use a trap bar or dumbbells). But you have to realize your low back muscles are stabilizers. Theyre not going to get big and strong. Building strong glutes and lats/traps/rhomboid are going to protect your back. So squats, hip thrusts, deadlifts, rows and, to an extent, pulldowns are really the major movements you'll want to do to protect your lower back",0

15957,"Yeah, you definitely want to do at least 30 minutes of cardio at a time to get the optimal benefit, so that sounds right on.

15958,"First I wanna say, thanks for the advice!

I have currently been going to the gym and running about every day except Sundays for the past week just to get in a “routine”. Being in a routine helps me stay true to something. I have been running/walking about 2 miles everyday when I do go, which takes about 30-35 min. I would just see everyone else come and run shortly and leave while I was still going and it made me feel as though I was doing something wrong. I definitely will add the lifting days to my schedule and remove a couple of the cardio.",0
15959,"You are gonna get really sore when you are  just starting out, and that’s normal. Your muscles will not be used to the workload at first, but will start to bounce back far more quickly the longer you lift. Usually 1-2 days between lifting is appropriate when starting out, and you can add more sessions as your muscles start to adapt. Since I’ve been at it for a while now, I only get very sore when I’m trying a new lift that uses an unfamiliar movement or when trying to test my max strength. Still, even that soreness goes away more quickly now that I’m adapted to the activity. (Lots of protein helps the recovery process, too!)

Alternating between cardio and strength training is a fine idea. In fact, cardio in between lifting days will help the soreness leave by getting the blood really flowing to the muscles.

I recommend starting out relatively slow. I began with 3 days a week - 2 lifting, one cardio. Now i’m up to five, but it was a gradual increase. It’s important to build your routine and confidence early, so don’t do too much and burn out. Also, make those sessions intense and give it everything you have. I think it’s way better than long, drawn out gym sessions. Quality over quantity.",0

That’s what I did, and I watched some workout videos from women about what they eat in a day... if you wanna make it even easier,
the most important two are: 1. Protein intake, 2. Calories

1. Protein intake, you can check google on how much protein you need for your weight, add 10-40 grams (This might be bullshit because I am doing it like this, but can be wrong... I eat a lot of meat anyway so this is totally doable for me) of that if you wanna build muscle
Just make sure you get enough protein!
2. Calories intake. Use my fitness pal to check some of the stuff you usually eat and their calories, just to get a basic idea about calories, and check your TDEE (I haven’t even done that even...) or not. Eat around 1300-2300 is usually safe and normal, 2500-4000 too much (but if you workout and you are doing body building, 3000 would be normal... over 4000 is cheat day usually.
Also your average workout burns probably 200-600 calories per hour, some HIIT studio claims they burn up to 1000 calories but most of the gym work you do will be around 200-600.

16008,"[It is very likely not fat but water retention (or bloat) caused by cellular inflammation.  ](https://www.garciaweightloss.com/blog/chronic-inflammation-weight-gain/) 


For those who won’t read the link above, allow me to quote a few  choice words from the web site.

How does inflammation causes weight gain?

“Inflammation can also affect body weight in numerous ways....
... When the body becomes resistant to insulin, the pancreas must release more of it, which triggers the body to store fat. Individuals with insulin resistance tend to store more fat in the abdominal region”

OP does this sound familiar?  Read on.

What are inflammation causing foods?

“Certain foods naturally trigger inflammation in the body. These include sugar, vegetable oils, fried foods, refined carbohydrates, artificial sweeteners, and other artificial food additives.

Many of these foods contribute to the formation of acid in the body, which increases inflammation. Other acid-forming foods include coffee, dairy products, soda, most sports drinks, bottled fruit juice, potato chips, alcohol, processed meats, and red meat.”

So OP, perhaps you need to clean up your diet (ie. food intake) to restrict these foods.  Don’t reduce your calories but replace them with healthier alternatives.  

One client of mine, was just like you.  I asked her to replace her morning oatmeal with eggs and fruit.  Guess what?  The belly disappeared.  

Inflammation also explains my 10lbs of weight gain and 1.5 inches gained around my waist after spending 4 days in Vegas for a bachelor party.  My pants were unbuttoned for the flight home.  I drank booze and ate garbage for 4 days and generally felt like a bag of crap.  

I lost all of it in 2 weeks when I went back to my healthy eating.  Did I gain 10 lbs if fat in 4 days?  Of course not.  

This also explains why people lose so much weight in the first couple of weeks of dieting (ie eating healthy).  They are reducing inflammation and losing the bloat (water) from their bodies.",0

You should work out at Least two times a week. After an Workout (not cardeo) you should Skip at least one Day (Some people need two, it realy depends) if you are doing Body parts isolated (like Leg day, Chest&amp; Abs day, Arms day) you dont have to skip a day (just dont Workout on the same Area)

16050,"Hey! You are indeed very skinny!! Don’t let people tell you otherwise. I totally get your frustration and I am also a beginner (start to train consistently for 3 months for now) I will try to answer few of your questions from my experiences and research:
1. About your body from the stats you provide:
You are indeed very skinny according to your BMI, normal or underweight even, but you probably have high body fat percentage, that leads you to weigh less because fat is lighter than muscle and still have visible fat. Don’t need to get obsessed over body fat percentage though, because it’s not very easy to measure than accurately everywhere.
2. Why do you still have belly fat there: imagine your body being a water bucket, when the water gets out of the bucket, fat at some places are like the water in upper part of the bucket, they might go down first, fat in some other part of your body might be lying on the bottom of the bucket, they only start to leave your body when you are almost emptying the bucket completely. In your case, your belly fat might lie under your bucket. This is highly dependent on genetics. So your way to reduce them is to continue burn fat and build muscle in the same time.
3. Here is how to burn fat and build muscle:
You can either go with bulk/cut cycles or body recomposition. Check all these terms up in google, (also check progressive overload) you will get enough information that will explain better than me. Having a consistent plan helps me a lot to track my progress.
In your “skinny fat” position, I would highly recommend you to do both, instead of just trying to burn fat.
4. Dieting: ok I totally get you on this one. I love food for my whole life and I never ever want to diet. No, not everyone who is working out or obsessed with fitness track their calories and weight everything and calculate their macros. I still don’t do it until this day.
But, it’s important to learn the concepts: protein, fat, carbs and how much is recommended for daily intake.
I personally started to get more conscious with food I am eating after I started to workout, I started to check the macros and calories of my food in MyFitnessPal ONLY WHEN I HAVE TIME. I started to learn the nutrition value part of the package. After a month or two, I got a lot more aware of what I am eating and I basically estimate my stuff. You don’t have to be harsh on yourself, just do a bit at the time and accept that you are not gonna be perfect with your food choice everyday but as long as you are getting more conscious, you will eventually get to a healthier lifestyle!
Also check intermittent fasting, might be helpful if you don’t even want to track your food by estimating.

Good luck!",0

There is a premium version of the app as well that grants you access to all the workouts, but the free version still provides quite a few.

16057,I am not a doctor or any medical professional but have had friends at that weight and you just need to focus on eating less and drinking more water. You burn a ton of calories by existing at that weight and if you eat a more sensible amount of food the weight should start falling off.

For most beginners I personally recommend 3x/week (M, W, F or T, Th, S) using a full body routine that way you’re hitting every muscle group three times a week. Another example is a 2 day split, meaning you perform upper body exercises on one day and lower body exercises on the next; continue that patten for however many days you want to exercise.

If you have visible belly fat, you're not skinny.

The person with thin arms and legs, but has managed to get a spare tire is generally an ectomorph who has managed to out-eat their metabolism.  Some thoughts:

1. Stop working out, and start training.  That is, have a goal, and progressively train towards goals, with measures for success.
2. Combine strength training with HIIT, or strength training with aerobic exercise.  We have good research now that is the most efficient training modality for getting leaner.
3. Measure things like your waist size and your strength/endurance improvements.  Don't measure weight.
4. Figure out how much you actually eat and drink.  Not conveniently sorta kinda remember what you want to remember.  Actually write down everything you put in your mouth for a week.  You'll be surprised.

I recommend eating 40% carbs, 30% proteïne and 30% fats. A gram carb is 4 kcal, a gram proteïne is 4 kcal and a gram fat is 9kcal.

If you're limited to your house for exercise and you don't want any equipment, that really limits your possibilities. Maybe try yoga? Or aerobics? An aerobic step shouldn't take up too much room. And there are a bunch of YouTube videos.

As for the asthma I’ve been working on controlling my breath my walking and slowly increasing tempo every few minutes. I find it so much easier to breathe and if I feel the pain start I just drop back down in tempo. Back and forth. Also, inhalers. But you probably know that already.

Anything is better than nothing! Maybe jump rope at home (dollar store has them sometimes). I find it harder to keep my breath but that’s a good one you can do anywhere (at home). Gyms freaked me out for a long time but I got comfortable after a few months of continued visits.

If you don't want to buy a kettle bell, there are a lot of bodyweight fitness options. I have a couple of apps on my phone. I do pushups, sit ups, or another app. I was surprised that at one point, I could do 50 pushups in a row. Plus a few pushups here and there isn't a big time commitment.

If you want to go outside or to the gym, there are endless possibilities. I enjoy bike riding. Also, don't discount walking.

The bottom line is that any exercise plan where you either hate it or feel like you're going to die at the end won't be sustainable long term. Find an activity you can stand doing, and keep at it. And always remind yourself that even if you only workout for a few minutes, it's still better than any day you're on the couch. So much of fitness is congratulating yourself and recognizing even the little things. 

One last thing, I enjoy video games, so I've tried several fitness games and enjoy doing them sometimes. I'm not sure if you're a gamer, but the Nintendo Switch, Wii or Xbox with a kinect all have a lot of fun games.

I scheduled a couple sessions with a personal trainer and she was awesome at showing me how everything worked, setting up a routine for me and walking me through it.  Once I got up the nerve to go for it and learn I never looked back.  It was the best decision I ever made.  It's a good idea to have somebody help you at first so you start with the right weight, know good form, and what/how many exercises to do.  If a personal trainer isn't available or in budget do a little research or even find somebody that looks nice (and knows what they're doing) to give you some pointers.  A lot of people love to be helpful.  Good luck!",0

I discovered I liked wearing ball caps also to help me avoid making eye contact with people.You should see my closet now I have like 30 hats. It's kind of like my gym blanket for lack of a better word. Hats help me avoid unwanted conversations with random gym people so my workout dosen't get interrupted. Who cares just do you, get a good pair of wireless headphones and zone out on the lifting. I honestly feel very empowered now that I never gave up. I can lift a ton of weight now and even smoke some guys on some workouts. Especially legs. I get compliments now from the intimidating gym guys .That in it's own is a huge accomplishment to me considering where I started from to now. Hope this helps best workout wishes",0

16182,"Knees are interesting. Often, when ppl squat, their hip and ankle function is poor enough that they compensate with knee rotation. That stress is what cause issues down the road.

I truly believe you can overcome any injury you've had to do everything a human body can do. The key is proper movement and full functionality of all lower joints. The hips includes those low back vert in the lumbar and sacrum. 

For gentle knee exercises, you may try low impact things like cycling, skating, eliptical. Air squats/wall squats should be ok, but make sure your knees dont go past your toes. This is where ankle and hip function come into play.

16185,"First, I agree with u/ErasumFenris that a good trainer or speaking to someone who routinely exercises is a great idea.

But, in answer to your question, some pain when starting is normal - but not sharp/shooting pain. Stretching should be slightly uncomfortable but not painful. 


I'd compare it to carrying heavy groceries vs shifting a full dresser:

* Groceries: your arms/hands are sore but the pain goes away quickly. Could repeat 10-15 times without breaks. Feels like an ache, goes away after a day or two.
* Full dresser: you feel like you don't know if you can lift hold something, feel like something will pop-out of place when you lift. You can do it once but not 10-15 times in a row. Feels like sharp/shooting pain and stays painful for more than a couple of days.

Typically, I'll feel sore on the day of the exercise, worse the day after (if I don't stretch), but the 2nd day I feel better, 3rd day I'm fine. If I've overworked, the pain might last for a week.",0
16186,"I’m not sure how helpful this will be as it’s very personal, but what helped me feel more confident in the gym was educating myself. Find reputable sources to help you understand form, what weights you should be using, how your workout should be structured, etc. Most of my anxiety when I first started lifting came from the fear that I was going to be doing something wrong and look like an idiot, as shallow as that sounds. Once I was confident that I understood the mechanics of the exercises and how they should not only look but feel, I was addicted to how strong it made me feel. 

If you know someone who’s into fitness see if he or she wouldn’t mind hitting the gym with you a few times to help you feel more comfortable and check your form for you. But be sparing with this! I’ve had friends and colleagues try to basically use me as a free a personal trainer which isn’t really cool. There’s a difference between having a gym buddy and being taken advantage of. Or, even better, if you have the means, hire a personal trainer for a few sessions!

16189,"What about it intimidates you? Are you afraid others are watching? Are you worried you will make a mistake? 

Lifting weights doesn’t have to be complicated. I stick with 5-6 different exercises and go heavy with varying sets and reps. Make it as simple and easy on yourself as possible. Have a plan in place. Make sure that you are tracking your workouts too. I do so in my phone, and that’s what helps me stay motivated - that progressive overload. I feel like a badass woman the stronger I become.",0

16193,"When I was training for a half marathon, I got the advice that you could train with ""on your feet time"". Basically on days where I couldn't do training runs, I could still practice being up and on my feet and count it towards the training. 

Maybe you could figure out how long you're going to be on your feet at the concert (three hours maybe? Four?) and start today by being on your feet for an hour straight. Then add on 10-minute increments every day. Even if you're just puttering around, doing housework or something, or standing and watching TV instead of sitting, put in the time and see how it feels.

FWIW, I'm in pretty good shape though obese, I have a physical job where I'm on my feet most of the day, and I still get sore after concerts. It's part of the experience. You're standing unnaturally, bopping to the music, and not paying attention to your body. It happens.  You'll be good, just work up to it so you can enjoy the show and be sore after, not during.",0

I doubt you did anything wrong! Just go at your own pace—  if they’re standing in 3rd position and you need to sit, do it! Just keep moving! Go slower, take off resistance, do a different position just keep going and drink LOTS of water during and after. I’d say start by going once a week max and work up to however much more you want because spin, like you said is wild! And your body has to heal after doing something so different than it’s used to. Your butt is also going to be dead from the seat for the first probably 4-8 times. Let yourself heal before going back so you can fully enjoy it:) happy cycling!!!",0

I began doing real easy exercises like the “bird-dog” and “cat stretch”, along with full body stretching (as long as it wasn't painful),  back extensions came latter on a machine with almost no weight.

After a while, I was able to do a short routine of abs+obliques+lower back with only minor discomfort. I had to stick to that routine (while increasing the weight) for about 6 months to feel like my lower back was back to normal.

16230,"That's not a dumb question at all, and it's awesome that you are looking at incorporating fitness into your life at a young age. This is an investment that will make the whole rest of your life better. So the basic answer to ""What routine to do?"" is: ""The one you will stick with."" So if it's basketball with friends, jogging, swimming, whatever you like and so will stick with it. There's plenty of routines in the wiki. I'd say try several of them. I usually recommend doing a routine for 6 weeks, then take one week of moderate exercise to recover/deload. I do this 2 or 3 times and then switch up the routine and try something new. The other thing that I invite people your age to consider is that for many, many years; the military has taken people your age and gotten them fit fast. They are good at it, and the Army writes everything down in books called field manuals. The FM for physical training is [FM 7-22.](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN7938_FM%207-22%20INC%20C1%20Final.pdf) So you basically get a free ""How To"" manual here from the Army.

YouTube videos are an alternative but being around other people is my personal preference for exercise, even though otherwise I am an introvert.

Even if you lost nothing but fat, you’d probably have to drop another 10lbs to get your abs to pop out regardless of lighting and without cranking contrast on pictures. I’d recommend focusing more on putting on muscle so that you’re not 115lbs soaking wet when you have abs. People hold way more fat than they think they do and for me to drop down to 10-12% body fat (able to see abs without flexing and regardless of lighting) I’d have to drop down to at least 150lbs from a muscular 180lbs.",0

16241,"You can’t spot target fat. When you lose weight you lose it across all areas of your body at the same time. Doing cardio or eating certain food won’t trick your body into losing fat from exclusively that area. Just keep doing what you’re doing and adjust your diet as you go and you’ll lose it eventually. Lower back fat is also probably the most stubborn area for people. I’ve been down to ~14-15% body fat with 6 pack abs, shoulder striations, and the whole nine yards and still had a large enough deposit of lower back fat to grab onto.

16249,"I'm sure someone here will have a better answer for you, but have you thought of just starting small with something, then slowly increasing reps as it becomes easier?

Like, if you can do 2 or 3 back extensions before it starts hurting, do that consistently for a while. Then slowly up it by 1 or 2 as you can. If you hit a number that hurts, stop there, and go one or 2 less than that next time until you've built up enough to be able to step up again. 

I had an injury to my coccyx that made most movement painful but was able to slowly increase activity over time. I started with walking 20 mins a day, then increased to 30 mins, and just kept adding. After 3-4 months I was able to start doing some weights at the gym no problem.

The healthy way to do this is having a max of -500 calories deficit daily. This way you will reduce to the minimum the muscle reduction.

16293,"Very common for new lifters, it's most likely your form 

Try this:
-pin your shoulder as far back as possible, imagine crushing a penny between your shoulder blade
-as you lower the bar it should be ~45 degree angle from your body
-plant feet flat on ground, push your heels as hard as possible into the ground when pushing the bar up
-tense your abs
-bring down bar till touches chest, then pause for a sec, then drive the bar up while thinking about using you pecs

This isn't optimal for an intermediate/advanced lifter, but good for a beginner.

Hope this helps, good luck with the benching

Edit: to add to that u should try strong lifts 5x5. Basically do 5 sets of 5 reps of a weight you can just about do, when it's too easy increase the weight by 2.5kg. Good luck!",0

Next time something like this happens, when it becomes perfectly obvious that you’re being followed, assert yourself. You don’t have to yell or scream, but you’re perfectly justified in saying something, maybe more along the lines of “excuse me, sir.

If he doesn’t or if he gets offended, repeat that you’d like some space and move on. Then, definitely inform the gym staff and point him out to them. 

The fact that you preemptively stated in your post that you weren’t asking for it (in so many words) tells me that it’s possible you’ve absorbed some sexist nonsense. Your response to the first suggestion, as if it’s just unimaginable that you would loudly stick up for yourself, kind of reinforces that impression for me. Don’t be afraid to trust your instincts and assert yourself to men in these situations, when you’re in public. No woman deserves to be stalked at the gym, or anywhere, as she goes about her business.

16307,"I would recommend calisthenics. You can do them almost anywhere without spending money on a gym membership and there plenty of good youtube videos with people showing you proper form such as calisthenics movement. In the end though, you need to find out what you enjoy most and also what your goal is. If you want to gain a lot of mass then I think you’re better off weight lifting. If you want to create a more balanced body with functional muscle then calisthenics is better. 
No matter what you do though, make sure you warm up properly (this can be done fairly easily in 5-10 minutes) and stretch after a workout. It helps you reduce the amount of lactic acid that’s built up which causes you to be sore.

16326,"Agreed. I started with a simple routine of 30 minutes cardio (elliptical with resistance or treadmill fast walking at an incline) then alternating weight training muscle groups with daily plank. 

I like to alternate upper and lower body. So, cardio every day, then alternating arm and back and legs and butt. The only thing I do for my core/abs is plank (I’m up to almost four minutes) and it’s been surprisingly effective at building strength and creating better shape and definition in my middle. At some point I might add more abs stuff to my routine.

I’d start with the weight machines, especially for arms and back. It’s simpler and helps you maintain form and stability. As you gain experience and get comfortable, you can switch to free weights. 

I started with body weight for lower body (squats, lunges, donkey kicks for glutes , and variations on those). I added weights to those over time.

16330,"I'm so sorry you're experiencing guilt and distress over eating and your body.  That has to be really hard.  I really hope you are getting help from a skilled clinician who has lots of experience helping people with EDs--that's where you are going to get trustworthy help for the core issue you're facing.

On the fitness stuff:

1. It's so great you're active and doing things like strength training and HIIT.  That's a great mix, and I if I had to pick two training modes to do, that's the ones I would prioritize.  Strength training will help make you fit in terms of being stronger (duh), denser bones/stronger connective tissues, body composition (how lean you are), and live longer/be less at risk for a host of chronic health problems.  HIIT will improve V02 max (heart &amp; lung capacity for work), metabolic condition,  body composition, and guards against cognitive problems and metabolic syndrome (heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes).
2. You definitely need a foundation of high quality food if you want to really benefit from training.  Different people need different mixes of macros (I do better with more protein and fat, less carbs; my daughter needs less fat and tons of carb and protein), so you may need to experiment with that.  But as a starting point, shoot for [120 grams of high quality protein a day](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/athlete-protein-intake/).
3. If you're getting plenty of good food in you--if you are fueling yourself with great food--a little fun food isn't a big deal.  Body-builders, fitness influencers/models--they have periods of time where they are super careful about what they eat, and they undergo weeks/months of very limited calories to get shredded for a shoot or show.  They can't have an ice-cream Sunday or a piece of fudge. The rest of us, who just want to be healthy and feel comfortable at the beach can do so.
4. You are so right to consider how your clothes fit you!  Weight is such a terrible metric.  I care a little bit about how much I weigh because I'm competing in a powerlifting event next week, and I don't want to jump up to into a heavier weight class and compete against people 20lbs heavier than me.  Other than that, all I care about is how my pants fit me.  In the 16 months I got a LOT stonier (added 65lbs to my deadlift), and I went from 179lbs to 183lbs.  But since it was muscle--since my pants are not tighter around the waist--I am not worried about it.",0
16331,"Agree with u/chabuddy108

The most important thing that beginners need to focus on is 

(a) not hurting themselves (whih will result in giving up) and

 (b) training at the right 70/30 combination, so its easy enough that you are motivated (70)and hard enough that you are really making progress (30). That will keep you going consistently, which is the most important thing. Then you will figure out how to improve etc",0

When you go for muscle failure, beyond that or for a high metabolic stress, your CNS will tire and therefore no longe be able to activate as many muscle fibers as if it wasn’t stressed. The CNS is the limiting factor, not the muscle itself. You can double or tripple your workload by implementing short periods of time without tension to give your CNS time to recover. The overall tension in this workout will be much higher and will not only increase your strength at a much higher rate, but also causes hypertrophy by mechanically stimulating more fibers due to a fresher CNS.

Whole grain doesn't actually mean the grain is whole and unprocessed (a whole, unprocessed wheat grain would look more similar to a grain of rice).

Said flour can be whole grain because it was made with unrefined grains or it can be regular white flour which is made with refined grains.

There are typically three different kinds of grains. White, enriched, and whole. White is where the germ of the grain is completely removed, enriched is where it is removed but some stuff is out back in, and whole is where the germ is still in there.

Into the next related point- whole grain, while still being grain, is absurdly better for you than degermed grain. This is because all of the nutrients and protein and stuff is in the germ, which is why having and eating the germ of the wheat is so much better for you than the essentially empty calories that white bread gives you",0

Not sure where you read that time under tension is not important.

Creating *enough* tension will create a burn (lactic acid buildup). So by reaching the point of the burn, that implies that you're creating enough tension.

If you stop before you even feel the burn, it is a sign that your body (nervous system) already knows how to perform that number of reps and is efficient at it (in terms of energy production). If it is efficient at it, that implies that you have not yet subjected it to a new stimulus ... which means no adaptation.",0

To minimize stress and maximize exercise volume to build strength and size.",0
16369,"Wanted to add-- **Recovery &amp; nutrition are VERY IMPORTANT.**

**Recovery:**  Get enough good quality sleep, and make it a point to take rest days. You repair &amp; build muscle when you REST, it's not like your body gets to work putting in more muscle fibers THAT night.

**Nutrition:**  Protein is the building block of muscle. You don't have to dial it down to # grams of protein per lb of lean body mass if that stuff is too overwhelming. Shooting for 1/3 of each of your meals as protein is totally fine to start with.

**And a note about pushing yourself super hard during each workout:** ""No pain no gain"", ""mind over matter"", ""go hard or go home"", ""rip the bandaid off"" ... that's a quick way to burn yourself out. Slow &amp; steady wins the race! Your nervous system needs a break too (remember, from the body's perspective, ALL stress comes from the same resource.. workout, work, family, etc) AND going at this high of an intensity increases risk of injury. In the long run, better to have a solid, consistent training routine than going really big for a few wks, out &amp; recovering for a few more wks, rinse &amp; repeat.

Totally unrelated but take progress pics! Never too early to start :D",0
16370,"Tbh, I’ve learned to be generally cautious when asking advice from my doctor about nutrition. Most don’t have a strong background in nutrition, and many have an old school mentality when it comes to nutrition as medicine.

16381,"I tend to vary my programming based on what fits best with my life at any given time. If you’re making progress with both styles, I’d go with what you enjoy doing the most, and with what fits best into your time constraints. 

Having used both methods at different times, I personally found a full body program to work really well for me. It meant I didn’t have to be in the gym 6 days per week to hit every muscle group twice a week, and it meant that if I missed a session, had a day where I wasn’t feeling 100% or needed a bit more recovery between sessions, I could move my week around more easily without throwing my training volume off too far. It also means that my body has more time to recover, which is massively important if training isn’t the biggest focus of your life, and if other things are adding to your overall stress. In terms of progress, I found that a well arranged full body split will allow you to make just as much progress as a PPL. In fact, I used a full body split while working towards my last squat PR. 

Having said all that, the biggest thing is consistency. Pick the split that works best with your life and that you enjoy the most. If you love being in the gym, a higher frequency split will work better. If you like training full body then go that path. I know that when I have more gym time available I tend to switch away from my full body split and focus on upper lower splits because I really enjoy using those, but it all depends on what you like in this scenario. 

In answer to some of your questions regarding strength and protein synthesis- strength is determined by your muscle cross sectional area (muscle size) and your neuromuscular efficiency (ability to use it). Adding size to your muscles with protein synthesis will potentially increase your strength, but only if you also learn to fire it correctly. To increase neuromuscular efficiency, which I believe has a greater impact on overall strength, you want to be practicing whatever it is you want to get strong at more often. For instance, setting my last squat PR with full body, I was able to squat 3x per week, which let me practice my technique and execution under good loads. Using a PPL, I’d only have been able to squat twice each week, which would mean I got less practice in. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it was something I tweaked intentionally for me. 

Anyway, TLDR- if both options are comparable, pick a split that fits your lifestyle and preferences best, they are both comparable in gains, because in the end consistency wins over any one split.",0

16397,"18. Thinking that doing crunches/ab exercises will give you visible abs
This goes hand in hand with what he said about fat and muscle being two completely different entities. Building muscle (which lie underneath your fat) will only result in just that: an increase of the size of muscle of that particular area. Therefore, doing crunches, russian twists, leg raises, etc. will all be great when it comes to strengthening and building your core but it won’t do as much when it comes to actually carrying out what most people are looking for: being able to actually see your abs. The concept exercising a certain muscle group and expecting it to lose fat in this area is referred to as “spot reduction” and simply will not work. There’s no way to pick and choose what body parts you want to lose fat from. This was one of the more devastating facts I learned a few years ago.

The only way for you to reach a low enough body fat to where you can see your abs is by shedding body fat AS A WHOLE. The only way for you to go about this is sadly through none other than your diet. 

“Fat loss is systemic, meaning it happens throughout your whole body, not one trouble spot at a time. To reduce fat in any one place, you really need an old-fashioned more-calories-out-than-in approach that addresses body fat as a whole”

16398,Rice and oat are good carbs because they are complex and it takes longer for a body to digest. White bread is not so complex and the body digest it very fast which means if you don't burn it fast enough it will turn into fat.,0

16403,"What most people don't realize is that weightlifting is a fantastically versatile form of exercise - it can be used in so many ""modalities"" for different goals - strength, power, muscle gain (hypertrophy), weight loss, endurance ... you can even do 2 sets of the same exercise one for strength and another for endurance.

Unless you're injured or find lifting weights excruciatingly boring, your #1 focus is going to be weightlifting. Some cardio can be added for supplementary benefits.

Keep in mind - weightlifting taxes all the energy production systems of the body. In other words, it burns carbohydrates and fats (and another stored energy form). So, when it comes to fat loss, weightlifting is king.

An outline to get you started:

\- Lift 4 or 5 days a week. After each lifting session, do 20-30 minutes of cardio such as treadmill / biking, etc. You don't need more cardio than that.

\- Focus on ""compound"" exercises that utilize many / big muscle groups at once. Examples - sled pulling / pushing, squats, deadlifts, bench presses, chin-ups. These are amazing for weight loss, because more muscle recruitment = more energy burned per second. By contrast, biceps curls and ab crunches are ""isolation"" exercises that will target one muscle to strengthen.

\- Eat about 100 - 150 gm protein per day, enough carbs for energy purposes, and a small amount of good fats. Google for more details.",0

16408,Correct! Intensity does affect energy systems. That's why I stated in the beginning that it's hard to answer the question because OP didn't specify how hard they were working. The only thing that could be answered was whether or not there's a difference in effect between walking for 1 long duration vs 2 shorter durations with the same distance. BOTH intensity and duration does decide what energy system would be used. It's not one more than the other.,0

16411,"Hey, just wanted to throw a quick clarification out. Your body using fats or carbs for energy isn’t strictly related to how long you’re training for. It’s more closely related to the energy systems and intensity of work. Higher effort work uses carbohydrates for fuel because they are more easily accessible and feed in to certain metabolic pathways to create energy faster, while fats are more often used in lower intensity efforts because they create a lot of energy, but it’s slower to release. Your body constantly switches between the two sources of fuel based on intensity of effort and fuel availability. 

The concept is called metabolic flexibility, and is way more complicated than that when you dive in, but it is a really cool adaptation we make use of all the time",0

About your question if you do 5+5 or 10 km in a single stretch wouldn't matter since the total effort is same that is 10km.

I hope you find it helpful :)",0
16414,"It's really hard to answer this question because we really can't compare how fast you were walking or how much you were exerting with each step. But just know that energy is fueled by carbohydrates in your body, and once that sugar runs out, our bodies rely on fats for fuel. So THE LONGER YOU perform aerobic exercises (walking, running, cycling) the more chance your body would use fat for energy. This is why you hear the term ""fat burning"". So yeah, the 10k walk you're doing MIGHT be more effective than the two 5k's but that doesn't mean those two 5k's are not working. Remember any movement is better than no movement at all. So keep moving and eat healthy!",0

16429,"""Resistance training"" just means using your muscles to move something (vs, say, yoga or running or climbing.)

Lifting weights is a type of resistance training- the weight 'resists' you moving it. 

Resistance Bands are an alternative to weights. Some prefer one over another. 

You can also do body weight training (pushups, situps, etc.) if you don't have access to equipment and you can absolutely get super strong that way, too. (Look up 'calisthenics.')",0

16432,"Also: if you're going to do resistance training (weights/bands) choose a weight that you can do 5-10 times or so. Do 4-5 sets of this per workout. 

You should have a 'pump' after a workout - it's increased blood flow to the muscle groups. They feel tight and slightly sore, in a good way. This blood flow helps the growth

When you exercise, you are naturally going to stimulate muscle growth. So, you cannot expect to lose both muscle and fat. In fact, muscle will naturally atrophy (waste away) if you stop exercising. But then, you will gain fat !

The only way to do what you want is to really cut down your food intake, in addition to exercising. And I mean ... cut it down a LOT. Then, you will start losing muscle and fat ... because your body is just not getting enough energy for exercise so it will break down even the proteins to get glucose.

16489,"Ok, I understand what you want, but it is not always easy to isolate the shoulders 100% without hitting the trapezius (""traps"" or ""neck muscles""), because they often work together when you do upper body lifts. If you pay close attention to your shoulder area when you do shoulder presses, you will feel the traps working ... this is 100% natural ... that is meant to happen. The traps are a stabilizer muscle when you do shoulder presses (either straight up presses or even lateral raises).

Realize that genetics also plays some role in the development of individual muscles. Some guys have massive chests with minimal effort. I have big arms with minimal effort.

The only way I can think of is - ***use dumbbells, DO NOT use barbells*** 

... for any shoulder (or more generally, upper body) lifts. When you use dumbbells, the load is asymmetrically distributed to one side, and it is easier to isolate the delts. When you use a barbell, however, the load is spread across the entire upper body, and the traps will play a much greater role in the lift.

Remember that the body will adapt to whatever stimulus you subject it to. If you sit on the couch all day, testosterone production will be reduced because the body doesn't see a need for it. However, if you work out at high intensity, it will be increased.

Cause it abso fucking lutely will. Ur not happy cause ur ass is flat and legs are thin. Guess what. We have these things called gyms and if you do leg and butt exercises and eat and rest. Your  butt will look better and your legs will look better. You ll also feel healthier, stronger , less confidence isssues caused by your insecurities from your legs and butt, more overall happiness from the release of dopamine after a workout. I see 0 negatives here. Dont be content. Love yourself for more than just your body but realize that adressing these issues and working on them will make you feel better. Working out is fun. Do the leg workout i gave you and you ll be more than fine in the long run. You ll notice a lot of changes by your birthday.",0

1. When you burn more calories the body tells you to ingest more calories to replace them. You have to be sure you are not eating extra to cover the calories burned.
2. Going from 0 minutes to a meaningful solid 30 minute jog at a decent pace is near impossible. If you want to get into jogging, you might want to check out the couch to 5K program.

I have been most successful with exercise and fitness when I make small changes and goals, and continue to add on changes and goals gradually. People try and change every one of their habits at one time, and for me, this is guaranteed failure. For example, you could start by cutting soda out and jogging thirty minutes four days a week, and then in a few weeks try to add a new healthy habit. It can be so overwhelming to cut out all the foods you like and exercise every single day. Also, I know a lot of people that have been successful by eating five(ish) smaller meals a day. Maybe you can look into an eating routine like this! This is a bit controversial though, and everyone you talk to will have different opinions on it.

As far as your upper body you are fairly out of commission as no weight should be in that arm for 4-6 weeks and then hanging over it and slightly rotating your shoulder using just the weight of your arm is where to start. If you can do crunches in a comfortable position that should be fine, recommend a little cushion in the shoulder blade area for when you come down. Taking the hit and letting it heal properly and then slowly restrengthening will be a lot more worth it in the long run. Use your sling and switch to a figure 8 brace as it starts to get better so you can slowly get range of motion back. It heals wrong and it will just continue to rebreak",0

I've never been able to figure out why, but I have always felt like something was off about my form despite many people telling me I was doing them correctly. It has never even crossed my mind that my problems could be due to my flat feet, so thank you for this!

I did a quick browse of the internet and found this article:

 [https://flatfeetpro.com/workout-with-flat-feet/](https://flatfeetpro.com/workout-with-flat-feet/) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure that this will help you, but I am definitely going to try the mental cues this cite suggests. From the cite: ""One of the best is to actually visualize yourself spreading the floor below you apart as you squat. This will trigger your brain to keep your knees better aligned."" 

Another thing I read is to make sure that your toes point in the same direction as your knees, so some people with flat feet have benefited from a stance where their toes are pointed only very slightly outwards.

16561,"Meal prepping helps alot for a healthier diet and saves money. My advice would be making the lifestyle change and not go on some crazy diet. (I had to change mine due to hypertension and I'm only 34) You won't see results as fast as you might like but its more sustainable in the long-term. Just start with healthy foods that you actually like or just healthier versions and slowly change your diet and build a diet around that. Healthy recipe books help if you like cooking.

As far as exercise, I've been struggling with finding a routine myself after letting myself get out of shape and was starting to develop a ""dad bod"". I could never find a realistic routine for me but lately I've been working on the old version of the army physical fitness test. Essentially its timed fitness test for Push ups, Sit ups, and a 2 mile run. The goals for each are based on age group.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_Army\_Physical\_Fitness\_Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Physical_Fitness_Test) 

I'm sure there are people on here who are in better shape and further along in their journey to be healthy than I am who will give you much better advice. But if your just trying to get in shape or get back into shape, the goals for the test are reasonable but just challenging enough and its a pretty good overall workout. Also it doesn't require a gym or any equipment other than a stop watch.

This is kind of going on but it’s 4 am and I’m grinding them essays and the adderall is doing its thing.

Particularly in women, who are generally built stronger in their lower body than their upper bodies (like men), squats are a must.

If you do just one exercise, let it be squats.

As far as diet goes, trial and error is going to be required. Each body is different. Perhaps one general piece of advice I can give you is to eat protein and good healthy fats like avocado and natural peanut butter.

I like what the above \^ person said - start with a small caloric surplus like 200 cal / day, and see where that takes you ... give it 2-3 weeks ... if you don't like the results, adjust accordingly.",0

If you're serious about results, you gotta fix the diet. No shortcuts available.

Also, I noticed that you didn't mention any lower body exercises ... you're doing upper body every single day. That is not only going to result in a top heavy (imbalanced, strengthwise) body, and miss out on gains by not working the big leg muscles and stimulating testosterone production, but you're also not giving your upper body any recovery time between workouts (assuming you work out everyday).

If you must work out everyday, at least alternate between upper body and lower body, so you get at least 48 hours between workouts for all muscles.",0

16579,"Eggs are considered a superfood in the weightlifting / fitness world. They provide excellent bang for the buck in terms of nutrients, so are an essential part of any broke person's diet (including yours and mine).

Bananas are also a kind of superfruit ... good balance of fiber, minerals, and of course the yumminess factor ... I vaguely remember picking up a handful of medium bananas for a dollar or two in the US.

Peanut butter is also a staple for many lifters, because of its excellent nutrients. The only problem is that the really good (natural) PB is expensive in the states - around $7 / jar. You can pick up a cheaper one for around $3 but it will have those crappy emulsifiers and shit. Late night munchies ? Grab a tablespoon and treat yourself to 2 tbsp of PB ... the only obvious danger here is that its calorie-dense, so limit yourself to 2-3 tbsp at a time.

Lentils / beans (kidney, black eyed peas) have always been a part of my lifting diet (coz I'm Indian) ... and are an excellent source of complex carbs and some solid protein too. Get 'em raw and cook 'em in a pressure cooker with salt / spices ... yumtastic !

In fact, a direct result of gaining muscle is losing fat. The more muscle you have, the more fat you'll burn throughout the day, and the better you'll be at keeping fat off long-term.

You want to lift with moderate to high intensity (always ensuring safety and obeying your body's limits) and eat a good amount of protein, small amounts of good fats, and a moderate amount of complex carbohydrates. That's the short version. Google for more details :)",0

Perhaps you have plateaued ... i.e. your body is so well adapted to your routine that you are no longer seeing results. Otherwise, without seeing a picture of you ... I'd imagine you look like a fitness model, given the routine you mentioned you are doing.

Or your exercise form is flawed ? How confident are you about your form ?

The only other possibility is that your diet is pretty bad. What is your diet currently ?

16592,"I think you already have excellent comments regarding exercise, so I’m going to weigh in on nutrition!

Gain muscle in the gym - lose weight in the kitchen. 

I love eating out and it’s my favorite thing to do. But once I determined my macros and saw my credit card statements regarding eating out I took a step back and re-evaluated. 

For me personally to help ease into the transition of healthy eating and meal prep, I decided that any craving I had I allowed myself in moderation if it was a snack food. I’d rather have two cookies now than binge on a whole pack of Oreos in a week because I couldn’t restrain myself. 

Any takeout I craved I decided I’d make at home. For example: my go to Mexican meal is enchiladas. I’d die with one in my mouth if I could, probably. But I decided instead of spending $15 for a meal with sides, tax, and tip, I’d funnel that into a homemade version. That same $15 can make me a healthier version with 10 servings with sides!!! Yes, 10!! And I can freeze some or use them for my lunches and dinners all week until I’m sick of them. This also allows you to know exactly what you are putting into your body and you’ll feel so much better mentally and physically about it. 

It’s easier in my mind to slowly adjust this way than just dive head first into chicken breast and broccoli for every meal until the end of time. It makes it less exciting to stick to your meal plan. 

Complementing your gym routine with a revamped diet will allow you to see physical changes potentially faster. But again, one day at a time!",0

3) To start, pick anything.  Just starting and keeping the habit for a month or two is what counts.  I do burpees, planks, pushups, and jogging. I have no idea what's next yet.

In my normal workouts i tend to exceed the 20+ reps regarding pullups and dips, so this is a new change of pace. I just really want to increase my health and self-confidence. Thanks for helping out another asian!",0
16597,"First, download my fitness pal. It's free for simple calorie counting(extra for macros etc). Losing weight is 80% diet.  Don't do some crazy diet. Calories in vs calories out. That simple. Don't fall for some bullshit diet scam. Yes eat healthy but in the end a negative calorie count means you will lose weight.

Second, find a program that you enjoy. Almost any will do. I follow AthleanX on YouTube. Jeff will always do lifts that are completely safe. If you have some money to invest, he sells work out programs. If you don't have money watch lots of his videos. He will cover everything his workout programs cover.

Third, ignore the gym bros. I have literally been told to eat more calories to loose weight. 99.99% of people at the gym have no clue what they are doing. I have heard all sorts of BS.

Good luck.

16598,"My advice as another out of shape Asian dude, who just started weightllifting, is to find a program that suits you in terms of time available and what you think is fun. There are a gazillion programs to choose from. Upper/lower or PHUL, full body, push pull legs, 5x5, GZCLP, bro splits, etc. Each focusing on either strenght, hypertrophy or both. 

Personally, what works best for me, although with a limited time, is working out everyday or close to it. I'm in and out of the gym in 45-60 min. and for now my routine looks like this:

Day 1. Back/biceps 
Day 2. Chest/triceps 
Day 3: Shoulders
Day 4: Legs 

That might change but it works for me. You can add abs and cardio to it. I don't do less than 8 reps in any exercise including the big compound lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead lift). I chose this way of training because it makes it simple to remember and simple to do. I choose 4-6 exercises for every day that I've learned to do with decent form and make sure to warm up first.

I use the app Strong which has routines already laid out and I custimized mine with exercises I think are fun to do and not to complicated or very technical. 

Watch YouTube videos to learn how to do stuff with good form. Educate yourself. Get motivated. Have FUN!

Good luck!",0
16599,"I have some advice, but it's probably not what you want to hear.  I have a big butt, big boobs, and I'm just self-conscious about other stuff.  If your body style is skinny, there's probably not a lot you can do about it.  Love yourself, don't worry about what everyone says.  Eat healthy, exercise because it's good for you and find wholesome things to make you happy.   I would love to be super skinny. The grass is always greener. If you are happy and confident that's more attractive than anything.

16604,"I would advise being at a small caloric surplus. 200  calories above maintenance maybe and start lifting. Eat a lot of protein and join a gym. Squats , squats , squats. They are the best exercise for your lower body. It'll grow your legs and your butt. My leg day i do 5x5 (first one is sets second is reps) squats, 3x10 to 12 ( each leg ) walking lunges, 3x10to 12 leg press, 3x10to12 leg extension, 3x10to 12 leg curls, and 3x15 calf raises ( either with the smith machine and a stair or the leg press machine. I'm also usually doing a thrust of some sort, either barbell hip thrusts or kettlebell standing thrust.  I assure you if you do this and stick to it twice a week for 5 months and eat / rest appropriately your butt and legs will grow alot.

&amp;#x200B;

Home workouts are possible. But it takes a lot of heart. If you're just going through the motions you're not gonna be able to grow. I know for me personally its a lot easier going to the gym and doing 90 total reps of exercises than it is doing 200or 300 pushups a day. Probably more to stimulate the same intensity. So yeah doing home workouts you're gonna need to push through the burn ALOOOOOT. Just my advice to you join a gym , if you wanna just grow your lower body you can do it 2 times a week.Monday rest rest thursday rest rest rest rest or you can also do abs on saturday. 

1, uhhhh maybe,prob not. You'd do much more at the gym

2, if you have no idea what ur doing , no

3 heart

4 focus on your protein, if you eat enough protein and fill the  rest with salads, rice etc (healthy foods) you'll be fine. If you gain 1lb a week ro so then you're doing it right , if you're not then eat more. You can count calories

1. You are probably stronger than you thought, specifically in your legs. They do an immense amount of work. That doesnt mean jump the weight way up though. This is a machine so it should be easier to move larger weights. This is because you aren't controlling the weight on multiple axises like a barbell squat, so much as applying to force to move it.

2. Since this is a machine you are probably doing it correctly, it is pretty hard to do it wrong. Check to make sure the machine is set up so you are starting and ending the movement in the correct positions and you are good to go.",0

190 lbs in 1990 due to open heart surgery (I had a mechanical heart valve installed). Within 8 years, I was 292 pounds.  In 1998, I went to the local community college and took every gym course I could against my doctor’s advice. I sometimes took four PE courses a quarter. I weighed 218 lbs in 2003. The coaches encouraged me to go to Cal State San Bernardino to study Kinesiology so I could teach disabled/handicapped students PE at a high school level. Once There people thought it was really funny that I was taking Kinesiology at 50 years old. I received no help from the Kinesiology Department with some of the harder courses unlike most of the other Kinesiology students. It was suggested that I give up and instead study Special Education by my department adviser. I gave up, disenchanted. I gained back up to 232 lbs by 68 years old where I have remained since six weeks ago when I joined a gym. The encouragement that led to this was a post on r/Exercise on Reddit by a 70 year old man who worked out regularly. I have lost 7 lbs since then. My doctor says I have to get back to at least 190 lbs as I am now only 5’9”.  (Age will do that to you). I am pre-diabetic and I have had cancer since 2007. I have been vegetarian since 2003.

16627,"Ok, then I'll give you the short version of mine ...

Throughout my childhood, I was the tallest and skinniest kid in the neighborhood ... thin like a skeleton. I was bullied beyond belief for this.

Fast forward to age 24 ... had my first serious relationship. When we broke up, I was fat and miserable. Decided I had to be in my best shape possible, with no idea how ! Joined a gym, where my first ever trainer told me ... ""It's how bad you want it"" (BTW, my words to you came from him)

I did everything the trainer told me to ... and in addition, ran 2 hours a day (before and after work) ... lost 27 lbs in 3 months. The same girlfriend who broke up with me saw me and said I looked ""sexy"". My body fat had gone from 18% to about 14% ... the lowest ever in my adult life. That was really the first time I had seen any real results ... I was hooked.

From then onward ... decided I wanted to be big and muscular ... started buying fitness books ... anatomy, nutrition, weightlifting. Spent a good year or so reading and lifting ... doing tons of research online ... and working out with more experienced lifters ... putting my ego aside in order to really learn ... saw immediate massive gains from just understanding the science and working out the right way. Got the women telling me they'd love to swing on my arms. The 13 yr old skeleton had become a 27 yr old hulk with a massive muscular body. Age 27 was probably my peak in terms of how much I could lift.

After that point, it's now just a question of what I want to do with my body ... sometimes I want to look big, sometimes I want to be really lean. I can do it ... no problem whatsoever. Because I have learned the science behind it and how my body responds.

That's the micro version of my *fitness success* story.",0

16631,thanks for the advice! this really answered my question,0
16633,You were on a boring diet that you cant stick to long term. Thats what happend. Idk what ur eating exactly but u can make delicious healthy foods. And you can also have snacks. Allow yourself reasonable treats. You can make french toast (no syrup tho) and have popcorn as a snack. You can even allow yourself 200 calories of whatever daily when you crave it.  Me personally i find that making the food and leaving it in  the fridge makes it alot easier not to cheat. So i ll make chicken rice and salads and save them. Salads every couple days chicken and rice weekly or so. If youre drinking a lot of water and filling low calorie foods like popcorn and salads you ll be full all the time. Just need to warch your macros and you ll keep on losing weight. On days you eat 3 slices of pizza. Its fine. You re living your life you can have tasty foods. Just eat alot more salads than you usually do and maybe skip on the caloric rich foods in your diet plan for the day. You just need something flexible and fun you can stick to. I will also mention that you re probably carb loading and i find it hard you re gaining 1 lb of fat everyday. Some of it is water.,0

16642,"Well, you don't have much of a choice given your condition. There's no point in speculating about muscle groups when you only have one or 2 choices. Do what doesn't hurt :)

Biking loads the quadriceps (front part of your thighs) more than walking does. This depends on intensity/resistance of course. Walking up a hill would perhaps be just as intense on the quads as biking with low-moderate resistance.

Of course, ideally, if you weren't injured, you would perform a variety of exercises, like squats, lunges, biking, swimming, hiking, etc ... which would be far superior to just biking alone ... and would cover all your muscle groups - quads, hamstrings, calves, glutes, etc.

That said, nothing is preventing you from isolating your upper body. So, you could do bench presses, shoulder presses, rowing, etc.",0

Any time you feel like quitting, or giving up? Remind yourself why you wanted to start in the first place. Don’t be so eager to start that you hurt yourself, but don’t half ass it either. Start with the basics. When I first started, it was simply pushups, sit-ups, and squats every day. Even if you don’t want to work out that day, do **something**.

Weak hip flexors and tight hip extensors can cause the “tweak” you’re referring to.",0
16746,"Ok, thanks for the additional info. That helps a lot.

I would characterize your goals as ""overall fitness"" which includes strength, endurance, flexibility, and weight loss (which will be inevitable as a result of all that + a sensible diet).

And, I would map out your fitness plan over a period of anywhere from 6 - 12 months, to lose those pounds gradually and at a healthy rate.

To start off, I would consider doing about 6 - 10 sessions with a trainer during which time you will:

\- Perfect your form (how you do each exercise correctly for maximum benefit and safety)

\- Set up a good regimen (i.e. which exercises, and a weekly plan ... what you do on which day)

\- Learn how to gradually push yourself up one level (i.e. challenge yourself ... more weights, less rest, exercise variations, etc)

\- Learn how to vary your regimen every month or so, because doing the same thing over and over will result in no more results !

\- Monitor your results to ensure that the plan is working, and adjust as needed

(Of course, ask your trainer questions about all these points \^ as you go along)

I think if you do 10 sessions ... let's say 2 per week ... that's 5 weeks. I think that's enough time for you to be able to gauge whether or not you're on the right track with your regimen.

Then, after the 10 sessions, you will have the confidence to continue regularly on your own. Now, you've perfected the form ... it's just a matter of resuming where you left off with the trainer. Continue your regimen (varying it every month or so).

If, a few months down the road, you either plateau, or you've developed doubts or want to take it to the next level, you can always ask the trainer to do one or 2 more sessions just to give you a little push because you've stagnated. Or maybe not ... maybe you'll be perfectly happy continuing on your own.

The basic idea here is that you want to start off doing all this under supervision, and once you're confident you know what you're doing, you continue on your own.

There will be trial and error involved - with both exercise and dieting. See what works for you and what you enjoy doing, coz this is not just for a month or 2 ... this is long-term. Don't buy into all the hyped marketed diets or fads.

\----------------------------------

Next steps for you:

\- Mention your exact goals to first your current trainer, and then any other potential trainer (if needed) ... say you want to do 6 - 10 sessions, and be firm about the goals. Be direct and deliberate. Ask the trainer how he/she plans to take you there ... when they answer, try to gauge if they're confident or BSing you. Do one trial session and see how it goes.

\- Once you've started with the trainer, pay attention to my points above (develop a plan, take notes, ask questions, monitor your progress ... because you are going to use all this info when you stop with him and start off on your own later)

\- Then, after your 10 sessions, see where you're at ... if confident you can continue on your own, I would recommend doing so. There's really no need to keep spending. If you've paid attention during your 10 sessions, that should be plenty. You can always get a refresher session later if required.

\--------------------------

Functional training

If I were training you, I would focus on ""functional training"", which simply means you perform exercises that mimic movements we perform in daily life.

Examples of functional training exercises (all these can be Googled for more details):

\- Squat (the correct way to grab a gallon of milk from the fridge ... also sitting down on the toilet seat)

\- Deadlift (if your back allows it ... this mimics picking up a dead weight from the floor ... your son's toys or something heavier)

\- Sled push / pull (imagine pushing a sofa or refrigerator to position it just where you want it)

\- (Explosive) Ball throwing against the wall - this mimics any pushing motion

\--------------------------

The many benefits of functional training:

\- They utilize multiple muscle groups at once (which means they burn a lot of energy quickly ... great for weight loss and muscle co-ordination)

\- This \^ also means less time in the gym because you are getting more bang for your buck with each functional exercise

\- They are *functional* ... they will help you with daily movements

\- They can be tailored / varied for strength or endurance or both ... e.g. by adjusting the weights, number of reps, and rest interval

As far as flexibility goes ... consult with your trainer about stretches, foam rolling, and other techniques. I'm not all that knowledgeable about it.",0

\------------

For a home workout, the simplest and best exercise is bodyweight squats - no equipment required, and can be done in a total of 5 minutes.

I have personally trained female friends at their homes ... and I always started with the squats. Even for men, they are one of the best overall strength/fitness exercises.

You don't need any equipment. Ideally, just a mirror that you can use to check your form.

Just google ""bodyweight squats women"" to get a video demonstration.

In simple words, you just extend your arms straight in front of you, parallel to the floor. Then, you slowly squat down (as if you're bending down to sit on a toilet seat), keeping your spine straight and head and chest up, till your thighs are about parallel to the floor. If you're a beginner, you may not be able to go that far down, which is ok.

Then, slowly extend your legs to stand back up to the starting position.

Repeat 10 - 15 times, x 3 sets, with a 1 minute rest period in between. So, that's a total time of 3 minutes of exercise + 2 mins rest = 5 mins total.

\-------------

When you get a little stronger, you can add light dumbbells like 2 pounds or 3 pounds in each hand, to make the squats a bit more challenging.

\-------------------

Diet

\-------------

Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, lentils/pulses, and try to get some amount of protein in your diet. If vegetarian, milk, lentils, eggs, and even certain vegetables (e.g. spinach, cauliflower/broccoli) offer protein. If you eat meat, your options are plentiful - eat lean meats like chicken or turkey breast, fish like salmon or tuna. Get a small portion of good fats like avocado, natural peanut butter, flax seeds, extra virgin olive oil.

Avoid ""added sugars"" (esp. High Fructose Corn Syrup), chocolates, ice creams, white rice, trans fats (often found in fast foods).",0

How and how much is your protein intake ? I'd say eat at least 50-60 gm protein per day.",0
16770,"Weight loss is a numbers game. A closer look at your relevant numbers might be needed to determine what's going on. Your problem might simply be the ***amount*** you are eating (even if it's all good healthful food).

They generally say that to lose 1 lb a week, you need a calorie deficit (i.e. burn more than you consume) of 500 cal per day.

There are several online calorie burn calculators that you can use, based on your activity level, to estimate how many cal you're burning everyday. This is never going to be exact (even if you get a fancy fitness wristwatch that does the counting for you), but is good enough as a guide.

Then, compare that number with how much you know you are eating everyday. The difference will give you net burn. I assume you're already tracking your calories on your app (using nutrition labels to determine calorie counts for each food item).

net burn = total burn - total consumption

First of all, ensure that total burn &gt; total consumption (or net burn &gt; 0). Then, adjust your consumption to suit your weight loss goal.

It's actually more complicated than that (because not all calories are equal), but start there !

\--------------------------------

Once you determine this \^, you can look at macronutrient ratios, i.e. how much Fat, Protein, and Carbs ... a good ratio that works for a lot of people, I think, could be 20% Fat, 60% Carbs, 20% Protein. So, if you eat 2000 cal / day, 400 cal comes from fats, 1200 cal from Carbs, and 400 cal from Protein. Ideally.",0

16815,"For military-type training I would recommend you do ""functional training"".

The kind of training you mentioned - chest and arms, shoulders and back, etc. sounds more like you're training your muscles in isolation. While this is not a bad thing, it is not a complete regimen for strength and fitness.

The ideal workout regimen, in my opinion  = isolation strength training + functional strength training. The 2 complement each other. Isolation workouts can focus on individual muscle groups while functional training can strengthen the body as a whole.

Basically, you want to use multiple muscle groups together in a ""compound movement"" that mimicks movements you would perform in daily life ... like squats, bench press or sled push, pull-ups, rowing, deadlifts (if you can do them safely). 

DON'T run to the gym. That will rob you of vital energy you need for strength training. I would say run on separate days or at a different time of the day.

Military guys in the US are required to do pull-ups, BTW. So, I would definitely do those. You may not initially have the strength for it, but lat pull-downs can help you build strength till you can do pull-ups.",0
16816,"I think I can offer a few tips. I've not only had personal trainers, have taught myself a lot of stuff over the years, and also studied to become a trainer (although I didn't go through with it in the end).

The biggest question is - what are your goals ? Once I know more about your goals, I'd be happy to offer more specific tips.

Are you doing this just to improve overall health ? 

Do you have a  specific weight loss or fitness goal ? Example - lose 20 lbs or reduce body fat to x %.

Is money a potential factor ? (Personal training is expensive, at least in the West)

Is time a factor ? Are you trying to ""get in shape for the summer"" or something similar ?

Trainers are hit or miss, in my experience. You have to find someone who is not only well qualified and knows his/her stuff technically, but also someone who is sociable and easy to work with. What's the point of having a trainer who looks super fit and really knows it all but is just trying to rush through the workout to move on to the next client ?

I had a trainer who was very good to work with, but he wasn't a good fit because he would easily get distracted and would flirt with female clients during my session.

The only way to find a good trainer is by actually training with a few of them and seeing the results and how it feels to work out with them.

I don't know which region you are located in, but you should generally do the following:

\- For each trainer at the gym, check out his/her qualifications (from their website) to get a feel for experience and skill level. See if their experience matches your needs. For example, one trainer might have worked extensively with people having low back pain (or has had back pain himself) ... and you have low back pain. So he might be a good fit.

\- No harm in scheduling one ""trial"" session with each of the trainers, to determine a good fit.

I think a good trainer will be patient with you, and know how to take you out of your comfort zone but not in a punishing way ... in a motivational way. ""Come on Jessie, I know you can do this."" 

Then, after the workout, go home and see how you feel the next day. Are you too sore ? Did he push you too hard ? Did he ignore your injuries or medical conditions ?

There is no short answer to this question ... you have to try a few to determine a good fit. Alternatively, just pick one, do 1-3 sessions with him/her, and if you feel good about it, continue.

That's a good idea to do it with headphones and try to ignore people. But I can't help but feel like I am doing something wrong when I'm doing the exercise in a public place. There is always people around. And I would honestly be fine if everyone ignored me, but from my past experience, there is always someone who comments on me (a lot of harassment, so I'm afraid for my safety) Although maybe I just need to search more for a more secluded space.

My family has a problem with obesity and I have noticed this. I've been born with a very attractive body shape, but It has always been hidden under my ""winter coat"" of fat. When I started home excersize I realized what road I was going down so I decided to take initiative. I would work out for months, shedding fat and building muscle. This is what I'm sitting at. Not much of a huge transformation, I know, but I know my journey isnt over. I want to continue working out so I can express my beauty both inside and out, as vain as it sounds. I want to look good and feel good, and hopefully help my body work it's way through he growing stages of my life by eating and just being overall healthy.",0

16871,"Im skinny, always have been healthy and exercise focused. 

Ill give you advise and you can take it or leave it.

Eat lean meat from humainly treated animals . Eat salt, who told you not to? Continue to avoid fast food and all processed food and SUGAR. Avoid sugar like the plague. Fresh fruit and a little bit of honey is ok but no other sugar. Not even ths fake stuff. Cook all your meals. Use myfitnesspal to count every single calorie that goes into your mouth for a month so you can learn to do it on your own.


Everyone is different and has oppinions but some people are plain wrong about nutrition. 

So about three hours a week of exercise, you didn't say how long it was for so im guessing you dance for 45 mins. It doesn't really matter because the models and actresses that have a skinny waist (and big butt if thats what you want) spend way more than that doing intense workouts.

Still you can make progress. I belive in you but youve got to step it up. Make it an hour everyday or two hours every other day.

Good luck",0

Ive gone through both trainings and can tell you the knowledge has changed the way I stand, breath, sleep, and even think.  

Highly recommend either program from Kelly or Jill, it all depends on your needs.

Personally, I love weight lifting and could do it for hours, but I struggle to find cardio I enjoy, but some people love running and weights bore them to tears.

Also, set a goal. But don't set something like, ""I want to get in better shape."" That's fine, but to set a good goal it has to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time based. So if you want to get in better shape, you change that into a SMART goal by figuring out how often you can work out realistically, and you say something like, ""I want to go to the gym three times this week."" If that works with your schedule, it's realistic and figuring out a time frame gives you a set amount of time to do it. It's relevant to that desire to get into better shape, and it's pretty specific. That way, you're setting yourself up for success, and you can keep adjusting your goals as you need.

Not sure where you are from, but if you’re in the US check your parents heath insurance, a lot of them cover that sort of thing. As far as the gym goes, stay away from weights, do push-ups, pull ups, body weight or band resistance exercises. You don’t want to get an injury as your still growing.

I know it sucks and is frustrating being big in school. I was at least 285 ( didn’t weigh myself after I hit 230 so I’m not sure how big I got) when I was 15 but stay with it and never give up.

Another great book is ""Deskbound"" which refers to specific problems with sitting.

The issue is not weakness, per se, its over compression and tension over long periods of time. Ive been working out, doing massage and working with a chiro for years-nothing made a difference like simple mobility work. Get some lacrosse balls, or other devices, like from Yoga Tune Up (Jill Miller) or MobilityWOD tools at Rogue fitness and release your tension. Also, get a stand up desk!",0

17057,when are people gonna learn not to bulk? You're gonna bulk 20 kgs over how long? Just eat at a small caloric surplus... 300+ max.,0
17058,cause you have a high % ( useless weight) and not enough muscle to move it. Most people struggle with pushups even at a much lower weight. I barely started off with 1 at 180lbs cause mychest was underdeveloped. We dont really use our chest for much in everyday life compared to our legs or arms.,0
17059,Pushups and dips,0
17060,"My right arm is stronger than my left but when i'm flexing in the mirror the left one looks bigger. I would just judge by strength. If you can do more reps on your right compared to your left it means your right arm is bigger. I think it could be a variety of things. Maybe right handed people just view things a bit differently when looking at a mirror and notice the other side bigger. Or maybe your shoulder is bigger so you notice your arm being bigger. It could also be that your left arm is getting more pumped as you're doing the same reps ( are u? ) on a weaker side. I personally try and sleep on different sides so i dont develop bad sleeping habits tho. But ye dont worry about it too much. Do the same reps on both arms and it'll be  fine.I would highly advise more than just arm workouts... you can use those dumbells for a full body workout with chest press , shoulder press , squats , tricep extentions , one arm rows etc",0
17061,"Are you struggling to eat quantity or just get your nutrients in? If you want more calories just eat caloric dense foods like peanut butter , adding olive oil to your salads etc. If you want to hit your protein target then experiment with different foods. Maybe fish will be more enjoyable than chicken for you. I can easily eat 3 to 4 thousand calories a day if i let go ( just to stay full) soo i'm on the opposite end of you. You can also try splitting your meals up more so instead of 3 big meals maybe you can have 3 average ones and 2 small ones in between. You can substitute your snacks for nuts etc.",0
17062,"technically you want to stimulate the muscles as much as possible with the least amount of soreness. If you're sore it lags your next workout.  If you are new to working out or you recently changed workout plans ( for example ive been working out for 4 months , just changed programs and my legs have been sore since sunday , technically i should train legs again today but uhh i'm not sure about that)

Some people go after the soreness. If you want to get sore you can superset 2 or so exercises and go to failure on them. Does that mean more gains than if you did normal sets with normal reps and rest time and pushing yourself hard enough? No , its even and most cases its less. So yeah soreness will probably go away as you get used to the intensity. And if you do feel them too often as a beginner ( i'm talking barely being able to get up and sit down couple days after a leg day without pain) then you should probably be  resting a little bit more between sets. Soreness does not equate gains just the way sweating doesn't.",0

Let’s say you want to loose weight for a couple of months, maybe start with that and then go on to muscle gain? I believe you can do that with a diet, lifting weights, good sleep, and resting days. A surplus of calories might be counterproductive but I’m not sure since it’s individual. However, in my case, I gained weight on purpose and then realized it’s better to start with getting my fat levels down. Although I’m still lifting heavy and reaching my PR’s.

I highly recommend getting a massage with primarily pec focus (this might hurt like a bitch — that’s okay), AND doing stretches for your pecs. although not your pecs, but still an anterior muscle, your sternocleidomastoid is the main muscle i recommend to mention if you do get a massage ... good luck!

&amp;#x200B;

I spent 8 or so months with a PT, and my health improved but I never really felt invested in it. It was a thing I knew I needed to do, my mindset was a million miles away from actually wanting to do so. As a result I'd make excuses, and never quite get around to it.

The problem is that when you talk to people who are invested in themselves like that they can't fathom how it would be to not be. So they end up saying 'just' a lot. Just do this, Just do that.

Diet is key for me. I’ve always struggled with a clean diet.  I’m counting calories now and maintaining a caloric deficit every day. I get for 2000 calories a day and I track as best as I can.

Eating a lot of meat (chicken, tuna, ground beef, sausage). High in protein foods.  Not eating before bed.  Green Tea and fish oil/magnesium supplements twice a day.  Protein shake for breakfast to get my metabolism going.  Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, almonds, beef sticks, eggs, for snacks.  

My diet isn’t great by any means, but it’s a significant change from before when I drank booze every day and ate fast food and other shit.

17139,"Hey, I think I replied to your last post about this too!

The answer to this question, in my mind, lies in how much training experience you have. If you’re just getting started with gym training, I’d focus primarily on strength work, as you’d likely get plenty of power work from the long jump training,  and increasing your strength would give you a greater potential for force production. 

If you have a bit more experience in the gym you should probably go the strength and power route, though I’d likely skew this towards the strength side as well. 

The goal in the gym is to help build gross physical characteristics that will benefit your performance. Power work can absolutely be of use in the gym, but if the strength isn’t there power training can only go so far. 

As for recommended schemes, that will vary based on your training history, long jump schedule and the frequency of gym sessions you intend on hitting. If we can put all these variables in place you should be able to put together a solid program that will improve your performance, but without more info on these areas it’s hard to recommend anything more specific. 

Feel free to DM me and I’d be happy to talk through some of the detail with you :)",0

So if your goal is to build a lean physique bulking could wreck that. You may think that’s where cutting comes in but often times all muscle gained during the bulk can be shredded off along with the fat.  If your goal is to put on lean mass the best way to do it I’d say is eat in a deficit or at maintenance but eat 1 g of Protein for every Pound of Body Weight this packs on good muscle that will last, but might take longer to be added to your frame. Just food for thought! (Pun definitely intended).",0
17143,Interesting. I'm not too concerned with actual weight loss - I know that the work that I'm doing will more likely balance out the loss of fat with muscle gain - but I'm curious as to what you did during that period. How did you alter your diet? How much more exercise were you doing?,0

If you go to a gym, you def want to incorporate more horizontal pulling (like rows, there are a lot of different kinds), and overhead pushing (""overhead press""). Make sure you do these CORRECTLY, which will probably mean you won't be able to work as hard as you think you CAN be... the point isn't to ""train hard"", it's to develop better control of your muscles.

If you start a balanced exercise/strength training program, there's a chance it might resolve without you doing anything more on top of that.

It’s even possible on that exact schedule to lose 30lbs in 60 days. But you won’t have much energy for working out and honestly you don’t even need to start working out til after the fat is gone.

Improving diet is a generally good thing, but might not have a major effect here because Tbh this looks more like a result of bad posture and sitting at a desk than a weight issue. 

I would also look into a cervical pillow, it will better support your neck and back at night to help it stay in better alignment. Get one with a carrying case because every other pillow will feel like complete trash compared to it once you get used to sleeping with one.

Strengthening neck muscles will be helpful here too. It may feel silly, but lie down with your head dangling off the edge of the bed and try to lift your head up using your neck, repeat x10 and do this every day. 

Also look into ELDOA postures, they look easy on paper but most of them you’re supposed to hold for 30s-1min and let me tell you, you will feel like dying by the end of it haha. 

Finding a yoga class that puts an emphasis on strength as well as flexibility will help, especially if they incorporate eldoa postures. 

Do you feel a lot of tightness and pain in your neck/shoulders as well? Seeing a massage therapist, chiropractor and/or acupuncturist can help. They don’t work for everyone, but when I starting going to a chiro for adjustments it made it easier/less painful to sit and stand up with correct posture.

In this scenario, full body training would mean you don’t have to do any two a day training days in order to hit all body parts, and it would give you more of an opportunity to recover as needed between sessions. For instance, if you’re jumping 3 days per week you could hit full body sessions 2-3 days per week and get a really good resistance training stimulus that way, without needing to do both sessions on the same day (unless you wanted to). At the same time, it would mean you can have a jump session and a resistance session in the same day and you would be able to have full recovery days in between if you chose. 

To me, full body in this scenario mainly keeps your recovery options more open, and still lets you get a really good resistance training stimulus in.",0

17258,"Hi!

I’m not an expert on the needs of long jumpers specifically, but I do have an exercise science degree, so I should be able to provide some advice here. The biggest things to consider when looking to improve for a specific sport is what will get you better at that specific sport. In this case, your long jumping practice itself will get you better at long jumping. That means you need to use that as the cornerstone of whatever split you end up choosing. 

From there, depending on how often you’re practising long jump, your split will need to be built to accomodate that. If you’re practicing fairly frequently, your split can probably (and should most likely) focus mostly on strength, and possibly throw in some power exercises. Legs will be important, and selection of exercises to make your legs stronger will be essential. Stronger legs=more force production which means long jump practice can help hone that into power. 

Basically, consider your long jump training frequency, and prioritise that first off. Everything else is secondary. You want to be maximally recovered come your sport specific training sessions, or if not maximally recovered you do not want your resistance training to get in the way of giving everything you have to each sport specific session.",0

I don't really know your preferences and please note that everyone is different so something that might have worked out for me could not be as efficient for you. 

I've done lots of sports in my life and I've found that weight lifting and calisthenics are the most relaxing things for me as well as sports such as Kickboxing. When you weight lift you release endorphins which make you feel happy. 

Either way, I think you should experiment for yourself and find what makes you feel happy and relaxed, it may help a little bit of yoga or stretching at the end of each session. 

I hope this helps!

17329,"At that age almost anything is going to make you stronger. Your own routine is going to be more likely to get done than someone else's, so it's good that you did it yourself :) 

I could give a lot of tips and suggest changes BUT I Don't see the need for more than two: #1: remember rest days. So instead of doing that workout every day, do it every other day. You get a lot of exercise that way AND your muscles get a chance to recover and to grow! 
Tip#2: you're pushing but you're not pulling. That's not good in the long run, so replace biceps curls with bent over rows. That way you get a pulling movement to develop your back muscles, biceps and lower back, all in the single movement! Always remember to pull if your program has pushing.

There are probably going to be a lot of comments of people telling you to use some other program, but at this point don't care about those. Your workout is going to challenge you for a while and to make you tougher. That's good. It will improve your working capacity and that enables you to use more challenging programs.",0

17350,"I only got a personal trainer after years of training  on my own and finally wanting to hit some bigger and heavier lifts. I didn’t want to pay for it at the beginning because there are so many free resources on the net! If you try it on your own and truly love it and think you need the extra help, then you could revisit the question of getting a PT but until then, feeling your way around the gym on your own with the help or certain online resources will do you good! 

Of course, the main concern with not having ever exercised is potentially doing it with wrong technique so that’s where a PT may help but you could always watch videos on YouTube on how to perform certain exercises properly. 

But to give it a go, perhaps you could try:
- fitness guides (theyre pdfs you can find on the subreddit called FitnessGuidesSharing). You might find some free ones floating on that subreddit! They are just a good start to learning how to use the gym equipment and focused on building muscle etc

- programs such as Sweat (its an app you can download and it’s a small monthly membership with daily exercises you can follow)

17404,"I think it’s really gonna depend on your (gym) situation. If there’s like 7 squat cages in there nobody is using, set the safety bars/straps at a level where you can do full range of motion (or as close to it as possible) and still slide off the bench laterally if the bar is full down and you’ve got nothing left. Or, get on a bench and always have a spotter. Or, get on a bench and always “leave a little in the tank” ... regardless, I’d recommend cutting down your weight drastically when you transition (say down to 50%, at least for a first set &lt;call it a warm-up&gt;), just because there may be some muscles needed for free weight stabilization that aren’t used to it on the machines.",0

Beginners are often stuck in a cycle of thinking everyone is judging them (due to high ego) and then using weight that is too high to seem like they aren't a beginner. This higher weight just results in poor form and makes you look even worse. We (advanced lifters) feel proud seeing beginners with good form using moderate weight. 

[14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ZgMeqx8-E&amp;list=PLvKddAXU4qdGmgejtrInsmT5rKMfENsVL&amp;index=1&amp;t=888s) There should be some kind of pain you experience whilst training / recovering.

To improve your weaknesses you have to be critical of them. The first step is actually admitting you have weaknesses (linking back to dropping your ego).

You (pretty much everyone) are weighing yourself wrong. There is so much more to weighing yourself consistently and correctly than just stepping onto a scale. Watch this part of the video carefully if you often find yourself complaining that you have gained weight after stepping on the scales. Chances are you haven't gained much fat at all. What the scale says isnt exactly what your bodyweight is.",0
17412,"If you're looking for a reason to start taking cold showers, to address your points:

&gt;cold showers reduces DOMs but also decreases muscle gains

You don't build muscle right after a workout; it's built gradually over time, with consistent training, recovery, and nutrition.

&gt;for stretching it doesnt have any downsides as youre not aiming to grow muscles necessarily just stretch them

You should be warming up your muscles before a flexibility training session, not making everything cold.",0

17415,Make sure you keep your back straight with good posture every exercise you do. Engaging your lats and keeping your spine long should keep you from hunching forward and using your anterior shoulder/neck muscles to compensate for not using your core. Remember to breathe through the diaphragm as well to help maintain your core position. Good luck!,0

17418,"Muscle building is about adaptation. You must convince your body that it NEEDS to change in order to adapt. It's likely you're lifting too light, too often. We are very good at adapting to light loads and long distance. Try short distance, heavy loads, as if your survival depended upon it. That spurs HGH and Testosterone boots which build muscle. Do big movements like squats, deadlifts and presses to engage more muscle groups and primary movers. Barbells are King, Dumbbells are Queen, machines are generally poor at their job.

Also generally speaking it sounds like you are looking to recomp, not cut, however if you have 10kg to lose it will be tough to see much muscle gain.

TLDR; set a higher protein target and NEVER miss it. Reduce your rate of fat loss, also make sure you are getting enough sleep.",0

Perhaps you can try to mix in different holds and the like.

Cardio is not necessarily the best or only way to burn fat. Muscle is where much of our metabolic drive comes from. More muscle will up your metabolism. If you eat less calories than you burn, you will lose weight. Do so in an appropriate way and that will be fat loss. Do it to an extreme and you’re probably burning more muscle.

SO.... get familiar with a resistance training program, do some cardio (Because cardiovascular health is GOOD!), get adequate rest (injury leads to being sedentary-&gt; gain fat)

17482,"KUDOS to previous comments.

To be sure I understand you well, you're talking about lower abdominal fat (not other medical stuff) right?

Well abdominal fat are the most stubborn and to lose them you will need cardio exercise (I use JUMP ROPE &amp; its result is short term) you enjoy and work well with not what you'll have fun with and not rip the result.

Do some body weight (you can add external weight as you progress) exercise to build muscle that will help increase your body metabolism to burn fats while you even sleep.   
\- Upper body: push up and dumbbells exercises  
\- Lower body: squat body weights and external weights, lunges etc.

Do them moderately if you don't wanna get toned.

You need to do some abdominal exercises, though they may not have greater impact in fact loss they will build you a nice and hot abs (even without toned muscles) while strengthening your core.  
Try lying leg raises, flutter kicks, reverse crunches to target your lower abs (the area where the fat is), add a bit of crunches, twists, bicycles, planks, side crunches or jack knifes to work on different regions of your abs.

Modify your diet to get max result. If you're not eating rightly then all your efforts will be a waste. Avoid large quantity of oil. Just eat healthy in good portions and at the right time.

Apply these formulas and you'd be fine. Don't forget to use the correct form for all the exercises.

I hope this helps..",0

This thread provides good info in improving ankle dorsiflexion. The best stretch I've found is to get into a slav squat and place a 50lb dumbell on one knee, forcing dorsiflexion but allowing my heels to remain on the ground since my center of mass is still low. See, ex.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwLM5n-rYmA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwLM5n-rYmA)",0
17505,"I’d also like to add that maybe you just have a really rigid ankle joint! Flexibility exists on a spectrum. It’s both related to genetics and well as how you use your body. Some people improve their deep squat and ankle mobility by prolonged deep squatting while grabbing an object for support, which is a long duration stretch, essentially. Seems to help weight lifters. Not sure if that’s your end game or if you just want to understand why.",0
17506,"Be realistic with yourself and don’t set overly high expectations. Try to be fluid. If one day you can work out for an hour, go for it. And maybe the next day you only have 20 minutes to spare? That’s fine too. Just try to get in some sort of physical activity daily. 

And as far as getting back into it, my personal suggestion is to start off doing just light cardio type exercise for a week or two, like treadmill, elliptical, etc. Get your body warmed up a bit.

Then when you’ve picked up some momentum with your exercise, slowly start incorporating a weight lifting routine. 

That’s what has worked for me! :)",0
17507,"Soleus is the deeper calf muscle that doesn’t cross the knee. It can limit ankle mobility but not knee mobility. 

The gastroc does, however, cross the knee as well as the ankle joint. Because of that, when the gastroc is tight and the ankle is at full range of motion, the gastroc can limit knee flexion.

17534,"your breathing pattern should match your pace. Your breathing at 3mph warmup walk is not the same as 6 mph jog. I take long deep breaths when i'm walking and they get shorter and more frequent as i  go faster. You should keep the same pace after your warmup and keep up the same breathing pattern more or less. for me its 2 seconds in and 2 seconds out. The goal is not to breathe too often or too little.  Try sitting still and over breathing you'll notice it.

If your breathing is all over the place you will feel like you can't breathe. 

I do feel the need to advise after reading your age height and weight that jogging is not the healthiest exercise for you.  Alot of risk on the knees. Its like 10 to 15x your body weight of pressure on your knees when you're jogging.  I know its  fun to do outside activity but i would stick to fast walks since its a lot healthier for your knees.  if you're looking for long term well being .. jogging a couple times a week is bad. Its bad even for average weight and healthy people. Its just t he bigger one is the worse it is cause it amplifies on the knees. I'm not shaming you i think its great yuo're working on getting healthier. I'm a bit heavier myself. If you have access to a pool , you can get tons of cardio benefits from that.

17664,"Spot fat reduction is not possible. You just need to eat less calories than you burn.

The best bang for your buck in terms of burning the most calories is low to moderate intensity continuous cardio (treadmill, stair stepper, elliptical) if possible. For example, 3.0-3.2 mph, 12-15% incline (treadmill). The next best options after that are riding a bike or jogging. With the bike being better due to lower impact on your hips, knees, and ankles.

Strength training for your arms would be some form of bicep curls and tricep extension. 
Time is hard because your should have the muscle under tension for about 40-45secs. Then rest for 2 minutes. Reps around 12-15. Slower eccentric motion. My best suggestion would be to do supersets bicep curls then immediately after tricep extension then 90 second rest, repeat. You want to aim for the last few reps to be to failure, with good form!",0
17665,What’s your core workout routine?,0
17666,"Everybody starts somewhere--everyone was a newbie at some point.  No need to apologize.  Also, don't stress out too much. One of the great things about being a novice is that it's really easy to get results.  When you are very advanced trying add a few more pounds to your biggest lift, or get down that last body fat percent, it's hard. But adding some muscle and shedding some fat when you first start is super easy.

A simple staring point is a Push, Pull, and Legs (PPL) split: a day of pushing, a day of pulling, and a day of legs.  This is a pretty decent example [using dumbbells](https://www.jefit.com/routines/24684/dumbbell-ppl).  Do your best to adapt it: if you don't have a bench, then bench press from lying on the floor, if you don't have a bar to hang from use leg lifts from the floor, etc.  That example has you doing 3 sets of eight reps--that's a fine starting point when you are new.  The real issue is ""hard sets.""  If you do lots of ""hard"" (to you) sets, then you'll get stronger and leaner.  Right now for me, deadlifting 385lbs 4 sets for 10 reps is ""hard,"" but two months ago 8 reps was ""hard.""  Make sense?

Lean mass is stuff like muscle and bone, but the part we're trying to keep &amp; boost is muscle.  Along those lines, make sure you're getting decent protein.  As a novice I wouldn't worry about it too much, but you don't want to be getting all your calories from carbs.  Be great if you got 3 or 4 servings of lean protein (chicken, pork, steak, fish, eggs, are all good choices) per day.",0

I know these might sound like really dumb questions but if i don’t know how to do things precisely i’ll be anxious that as you said,i’ll get weigh less but actually get fatter. I don’t want to mess things up hence why the dumb questions,apologies and thank you a-lot!",0

17670,"Congrats on being active and trying to get fitter.

To answer your question, that's probably not the best exercise protocol if you want to loose fat and get leaner.  The most effective thing you can do is combine strength training with either aerobic training or high intensity interval training, combined with a small calorie deficit.  Since you want to work out at home, in practice that could look like:

* Three days of strength training using [bands](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-resistance-band-workout) (or buy some dumbbells for home use).
* Two days of [aerobic](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/aerobic-exercise-examples) (jogging, cycling, an aerobics video) or [HIIT](https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/professional/expert-articles/6461/how-to-add-variety-to-your-hiit-workouts) work (skipping rope, calisthenic bursts).  
* Cut back a little on food.  It can take a few weeks to figure out--you cut out a little junk, see if you pants start to get looser over a week or two.  If not, cut back a little more junk and try again.

Some important points:

* You don't want to loose weight.  No one cares about how much they weigh.  If you had a ripped, athletic bod, you would not care at all about what the scale said.  Don't ever look at a scale again unless you are competing in something with weight classes.  Look at how your pants fit you.
* To get more athletic and leaner, you have to do two things: loose fat mass, and keep/increase lean mass.  The worst thing you can do is aerobic work by itself and loose lean mass, keep fat mass, and weigh less but be actually fatter.
* The best way to do both fat loss and keep/increase muscle is [strength training+aerobics](https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/professional/expert-articles/6461/how-to-add-variety-to-your-hiit-workouts) (HIIT works as well, takes less time but is way harder).",0

Spot training is basically the idea that you can target fat loss in a specific area - love handles, stomach, thighs, etc. It doesn’t work. Losing body fat is an “all over” process. Unfortunately we don’t get to decide where we lose it from and the places where we gain it first tend to be the places we lose it last. 

Your best option for losing fat is to watch your diet carefully. Exercising is always good but if you don’t do it in combination with eating well &amp; less, you won’t lose weight. At the gym, do a variety of cardio and weight training exercises. You can mix up your cardio to keep from getting bored - the bike one day, the elliptical another. A calorie burned is a calorie burned it does not matter which machine you use to do it. Weight training is important because builds muscle and muscle burns more calories at rest than fat. So that means even though you’re maybe only burning 200 calories during a weight training session, the muscle you’re building is going to burn more calories for you all day long.",0

Before I would get stubborn and excited to persist through adversity. That would leave me so sore the next day I could barely move. I would take a number of days off and eventually started to gain weight and get depressed about it.  

So for me I scale the workouts back big time and forgive myself if I don’t have a great workout. But they make sure that I don’t skip ANY days. The last year I’ve lost 70 lbs and gained quite a bit of muscle.  I feel a lot better and I’m hopeful for the future for the first time in a long time.",0

I’m sure there’s no real way to give me an accurate answer, but if I just need to work out and eat fewer calories, is there a way to know how much I should be cutting? Obviously if I consume 2000 calories a day and burn 2001 calories, that -1 calorie isn’t going to help much, but should I be aiming for -100, -500, -1000?",0

17734,How many times do you post. Anyway keep up the great work,0
17735,"I’d like to believe that there’s a fine line between blunt trauma and the actual damage done to the muscle fibers during exercise.

During exercise, you’re directly using the muscles themselves which are contracted exponentially to accommodate the heavy loads. If you’re just straight up attacking your muscles, if I’m understanding your question correctly, the amount of damage you’d be doing wouldn’t produce more muscle, but rather more scar tissue. That being said, you’d have to get through enough skin, adipose, and other tissues to get there which would of course be incredibly detrimental if you rupture a blood vessel or severe a nerve.",0
17736,GREAT progress but don’t stop now!!,0
17737,This was really helpful !!! I’m gonna stop the high cardio and try weights instead. I do find it easier to do sets of stuff. Trying intermittent fasting. :),0
17738,"You don’t really have to bulk to gain muscle, especially if you still have plenty of fat on you. 

One thing you can try is more hypertrophy oriented work, such as doing 3-4 sets with 10-15 reps. Then go back to your 5 rep sets and keep working on getting stronger",0
17739,"Sounds like you are doing a bunch of HIIT or otherwise rather high intensity cardio. If all you want to do is weight loss, you don’t need this. It absolutely does suck and you may burn out. You should probably focus more on simple, moderate difficulty cardio for 30 minutes to an hour. Things like jogging, or using the elliptical or swimming.

If you haven’t done any weight lifting, I highly recommend it. You push yourself for a set, but then you can relax for a couple minutes after it. It’s much less soul destroying.

Also while 178 for 5’8” is overweight, it’s not too bad unless there is some other medical problem going on. Aim to lose about 1-2 pounds a week. The best way to keep track is to weigh yourself right after using the bathroom in the morning every morning. 

And remember, they main change in your weight should be coming from dietary changes. That means eating fewer calories than you burn in a day. Don’t rush it. That can also lead to burnout.",0
17740,"The initial soreness should be mostly gone. When I leave the gym, I mostly still feel the tightness the the last muscle/muscle group I just worked, but I can still tell everything else was actually worked. If you’re just starting out at the gym, some muscle soreness a day or two later is a good indicator that you did work the muscle. Once you get more advanced though, the soreness will either stop or be much more mild. This is fine. You are still making progress.",0
17741,"Getting lean and cut vs bulk has nothing to do with rep ranges. That is 100% controlled by diet. Maybe you can burn a few more calories with a higher rep range, but it’s negligible especially compared to just adding on a 30 min to 1 hour cardio session.

Generally a lower rep range like 1-5 maximizes the strength of your muscles, while higher like 10-15 maximizes muscle growth. Both rep ranges will still make your muscles bigger and stronger, but they each emphasize those aspects. 

If you want to get lean, just keep working out and cut your daily calorie intake so you lose between .5% and 1% of your body weight per week. The leaner you are, the slower you should lose. The fatter, that faster you can lose. These numbers are based on the highest rate you can lose fat without losing muscle mass, or you can even gain muscle mass while cutting when you are not too lean and not an advanced bodybuilder or something.",0

17748,"walking for 2 hours will burn a lot of calories , prob like 500+ but if ur already eating 1000 more than you should then it won' tmatter. Its good to exercise but you need to focus on your diet. If you don't want to count macros ( even tho its advised that you do ) just eat a shit ton of low calorie vegetables.  For lunch and dinner. Have a little bit or healthy carbs and protein obviously with it but really. 1.5 kg salad with low calorie dressing is like 300 calories. Anyone who thinks they can eat that 4 times a day , add protein and some rice to it and still gain weight is crazy. salad gets your super full and it barely has no calories. I'm not saying eat salad 3 times a day for a week but implement it as your filling meal. People are different. Mine is at lunch. Eat a bunch of salad first and then you can eat the rice and meat.  if you're unsure then count macros but its near impossible not to lose weight this way. tomatos , lettuce and cucumbers i think are one of the lowest calorie dense vegetables. If you like something just google it. For reference lettuce is 75 calories in 500 grams.",0

17773,"Soreness is not the best indicator of a successful gym session, nor is how long you feel it for after the session. To me, what you want to be focusing on is progressive overload. With whatever rep ranges you’re choosing to work on, are you getting stronger?

Does the exercise feel easier week to week?

Are you able to lift more weight for the same reps than you did previously?

Are you able to lift the same weight for more weight than you did previously?

If your diet is on track, and your program is allowing for progressive overload and you are making progress with it, you’ll be making gains. One of the biggest difficulties we face in measuring our progress is the pace of it. We may have a big picture goal in mind, and we focus on that, and it seems like we’re not getting any closer, when in reality if you’re putting in the effort and the diet is on track you’ll likely be making so many small changes all the time you won’t notice until you see an old photo or something similar.

Keep at it, I’m sure you’re doing great, and I’m sure you’ve made more progress than you might think!",0

17777,I just bought the elliptical. I remember when I was smaller I enjoyed this machine more and lost weight on it. Wish me luck !,0
17778,"It all depends on what you prefer. Elliptical definitely burns more calories than a stationary bike as it simply requires more movement. Then again, the bike allows you to do more things in the meantime, so if you get bored easily while doing cardio and like to occupy yourself with something (like reading books or browsing reedit), I'd suggest getting a bike.

Personally, I got a stationary bike a couple of years ago so that I could continue my physical therapy after an injury. Then it became by go to in winter when I couldn't ride my regular bike (I was also trying to lose weight). And then basically my whole family started using it while watching TV. Now I can't imagine living without it. But I've always loved biking, so I might be slightly biased.

Anyways, try going to the store that allows you to test the equipment, see what you prefer and only then make a decision. No matter what you choose, as long as you stay in calorie deficit and continue to do exercises that you actually enjoy and can stick to, I'm sure you will get awesome results!",0
17779,Okay thankyou.,0
17780,I start with 20 min on the treadmill.,0

17782,"Ok thanks.

I just hate that I’ve been doing this for this long and I’m no closer to my goal.",0
17783,I guess it depends probably on the muscle group.  I would add a little bit of weight when if its starts feeling to easy. Dont go too crazy but ad a few pounds for a while and see if you are sore longer. I think a good diet also cuts the time of being sore so it might not be a bad thing.,0
17784,"I want to look [like this](https://images.app.goo.gl/hmzo7KtT7Ng39C3t6).

I guess finding the appropriate weight is the main issue. Going back to my original question, if I do the reps/set you recommend, using a weight that has me at my limit (the goal?) by the end, how long am I supposed to be sore afterwards? If 20 minutes later I feel fine, it seems to me that I didn’t do enough. But maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be? I don’t know.",0
17785,Lunges Lunges Lunges. High reps. Sets of 30-40+,0
17786,"I'm no precision by any means so you may want wait for a better answer but it depends what you are trying to achieve. I typically like 3-4 sets of 8-10 reps. 
Your current setup will like you get you lean and cut, if you are going for bulk doing heavier weight and less reps is the way to go. I dont want too much bulk I want to build strength and appearance is secondary.",0
17787,It's totally not normal and can lead to fainting and injury. It's most likely a case of incorrect breathing and bracing during lifts.,0
17788,TBH if you want to buy a machine find one that you like. All machines can help you lose weight you just need to put the effort into it. Exercising at an elevated heart rate (which varies depending on your BMI) for at least 15-30 mins a day will help you lose weight. Might want to check with your doctor before starting anything though to make sure there's no issues and give you guidance. Any activity that makes you get up and move more than you were before is also a step in the right direction.,0
17789,Okay thanks.,0
17790,It’s normal I think it has to do with your blood pressure. Doesn’t happen to me when I go to the gym when I’m not hungry,0
17791,any guesses? lol,0
17792,"After much trial and error over the years, I've finally achieved a physique that is closer to where I want to be personally.
First up, I don't take whey proteins, creatine, fat burners, any sort of chemicals et al steroids. I also never touch cardio as my knees hurt. I am happy I didn't burn loads of money on these supplements.

For past 4 months, I've done intermittent fasting intermittently. I've done IF before as well but after working initially, my body transformation would slow down. I figured, my body was adapting to it, not IF necessarily but the reduced calories.
So this time, I did my fasting intermittently, that would put 3/4 times fasting per week. 1 day of the week I would eat in surplus (not more than 200 calories), other days I would remain in deficit.
Other than that one big adjustment I made was to my goals. I was no more aiming to be whatever in say 6 weeks or 8 weeks. I just said, I'll take the gains as they come. I stopped monitoring and looking at the scale as it's deceptive imo. For me i realised, cortisol was critical, the moment I got stressed because of reduced fat loss or hitting plateaus, I would panic and that would halt my progress completely. 
I did not reduce my carbs tho, nor did I abuse them. I took moderate amount of carbs to keep me healthy, I didn't necessarily go for low GI like sweet potato, broccoli, oats etc. I would almost always stick to my white jasmine rice, my eggs and meats and fruits. 
Anytime I stood in front of the mirror, I was just grateful that I am leaner than the day I started and trust me that brought me so much joy. And anytime I was leaner than last time, the joy would be even higher, if not, I would say at least I am so much better than when I started. That kept me on track and kept my stress in check. I basically didn't set too high of expectations like 1lbs per week fat loss BS.
Happy to share more details",0
17793,"If you have never done squats or hip thrusts, they'll help grow your glutes mostly and hamstrings slightly. It goes back and forth in research, but lately I've seen research indicate loaded squats have more activation than loaded hip thrusts (I haven't seen anything in regards to unloaded). The probelm is once you do hip thrusts for a bit, you will really need to add weight. I think both have advantages, squat especially for quad and glute development and hip thrusts for glute and slight hamstring development. Nordic curls are another awesome hamstring developer. So you might get a little growth, but not nearly as much if you could add weight for progressive overload.",0
17794,"Hip thrusts work the glutes, and I haven't experienced hamstring activation while doing them, but if its just for the glutes they work fine! By the way you should go heavy while hipthrusting becuase I don't think they will help you grow your glutes tremendously without weight. When I started hip thrusting (6 months ago) I started with 20kg and now I am up to 160 kg for 10 reps. If you want your thighs to grow deadlifting and squatting should do the trick. You also need to eat a lot of protein, but carbs and fats as well. You don't need a lot of sugar, but you should eat it too occasionally.",0

17808,"You're more likely to lose weight by controlling your calorie intake rather than doing a one off exercise each week. 1-2 hours per week is not much activity. I will paste below NICE recommendations on physical activity:


Definition
Physical activity includes everyday activity such as walking and cycling to get from A to B, work-related activity, housework, DIY and gardening. It also includes recreational activities such as working out in a gym, dancing, or playing active games, as well as organised and competitive sport. (See the Chief Medical Officers' [CMOs'] report.)
National recommendations
The CMOs' current recommendations for physical activity (see UK physical activity guidelines) state that:

All adults aged 19 years and over should aim to be active daily.

Over a week, this should add up to at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate intensity1physical activity in bouts of 10 minutes or more.

Alternatively, comparable benefits can be achieved through 75 minutes of vigorous intensity2 activity spread across the week or combinations of moderate and vigorous intensity activity.

All adults should also undertake physical activity to improve muscle strength on at least 2 days a week.

They should minimise the amount of time spent being sedentary (sitting) for extended periods.

Older adults (65 years and over) who are at risk of falls should incorporate physical activity to improve balance and coordination on at least 2 days a week.

Individual physical and mental capabilities should be considered when interpreting the guidelines, but the key issue is that some activity is better than no activity.

1 Moderate-intensity physical activity leads to faster breathing, increased heart rate and feeling warmer. Moderate-intensity physical activity could include walking at 3–4 mph, and household tasks such as vacuum cleaning or mowing the lawn.
2 Vigorous-intensity physical activity leads to very hard breathing, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat and should leave a person unable to maintain a conversation comfortably. Vigorous-intensity activity could include running at 6–8 mph, cycling at 12–14 mph or swimming slow crawl (50 yards per minute).",0

17814,"Potentially. Your bodyfat % has to be low enough. 

Add some cardio and diet. Lift weights if that's an option. Larger muscles increase the amount of calories burned to maintain body weight. 

You can actually be a little chubby and have a six pack but that would require massive abs. You can also be super skinny, have tiny abs/6 pack.",0
17815,"Reckon you go to your gp mate. There are a lot of factors like your weight and height and your mineral levels and vitamins etc. after that you can pretty much start doing push ups, sit ups, crunches, planking and some kind of cardio training, I’d recommend rowing cause it’s a bitch. You can progress but phasing into proper weight training but your food intake is what matters. You need to get all of the proper things which you will know after you see a gp.",0
17816,"Try doing a lot of cardiovascular training or core training like rowing machines and treadmills. Some people might say it’s a waste of time but it’s the easiest to make a daily thing.

17863,I have the same problem. I have really bulky arms and I didnt like the look of them anymore. Unfortunately theres no much you can really do other than starve yourself. Im serious. In 2020 we call it 'intermittent fasting' lol. But it took me a solid year to get my muscle mass down. Generally I wouldnt eat 2 days out of the week. And when I did eat I wouldnt eat foods with surplus amounts of protein. I did still exercise but kept my weight significantly lighter than what I was used to and would only do bodyweight work for my arms because I didnt want them to grow just get more tight. Lots of walking helps too. Just be patient and keep having your calories be low. It will happen eventually.,0
17864,Thank you. Practice using false grip to allow more rotation and negative MU (from dip position to dead hang) to help build strength for the control,0

17869,"Coming from a competitive swimming background, I feel that focusing on breastroke for the entirety of your swim every time may be a factor in your weight loss as well. You have been building up your muscles and endurance to get better at that specific stroke. I know you said it’s only been about 3 weeks so it is early in your intervention, but I don’t think it would hurt to add some variety in your work out if you think you’d be comfortable with it. 

If possible, I would suggest trying the freestyle for some of the time you’re in the pool if you’re able to do this stroke. This could be as little as just a lap. There is a little greater speed to freestyle than breastroke which gets your heart rate up a little higher and assists more with fat burning. By swimming other strokes, you will target other muscles and gain more strength in those areas. Another thing you could try is just kicking with a kick board. This is a great way to get your legs moving and stronger. And it’s a little harder than you think! Good luck to you!",0

17896,"I wasted a lot of time in thr gym because I had piss poor nutrition and eating habits, but I turned it around not to long ago.

I'll say what worked for me. It might not for you but it will give some advice, I hope.

First it sounds like you need to do some meal prep. Find out how many calories and macros you need, there are calculators on Google that will work this out for you. 
My diet mainly consists of oats, eggs, rice, fish, pasta, chicken, sweet potato and veg. Nuts, fruits, flapjacks for snacks. I mix up the dishes so they don't get boring (I'm on a bulk atm so I'm not being strict with excess calories)
I try to eat every 2 hours through my working day as I find it easier to eat more at work than at home. These are not full meals but around 300/500 calories each 


2. Set alarms for eating times, if you struggle try drinking your calories. It can be difficult to get them in but definitely worth it.

3. If you check out the r/fitness sub there is a beginners full body routine I believe that will help getting to grips with it

I hope this helps",0

17900,"When I had to get in shape for my sport I firstly asked my coach and physiotherapist to write a workout routine that would best suit me at the gym. Then when I went to the gym I ask an instructor to show me how all the equipment works. When I got a bit bored of my workout I took to Instagram and searched either core, arm,leg workout and added some of them into my routine.",0
17901,c,0
17902,Maybe try a more relaxing type of exercise! Yoga and Pilates are very good types of workouts that still make you sweat and burn calories. Find a type of exercise that is fun for you! For example I don't like going to the gym but I love horse riding!,0
17903,"I think most people do have muscle imbalances, especially in their arms. Depending whether you are right or left handed, that side will be stronger and more muscular, but won’t cause any pain or issues so that’s okay. I never had an imbalance in my butt, hip and legs growing up, I only noticed it a few years ago during a long walk. I thought it may be because I was inactive for a long time and am overweight so I didn’t bother. Since then, I noticed my hip and butt felt tight quite a lot, like my right side was pulling down causing pain. I also noticed my right calf is thinner than my left (my brother also pointed it out) and my right butt cheek FEELS smaller, sort of like the muscle is being pulled down. I took to google and started some exercises for hip alignment but didn’t stick to it. Just recently, since starting my workout, I have felt more pain in my right side, so I googled it again and it seems like I have a tilted pelvis. I did some exercises to correct it yesterday before my workout, and it didn’t feel too bad. If it doesn’t improve in a few months I will book an appointment to see a physio, as it may be something more.",0
17904,I could probably pull this off but not for nearly as long,0

Easy fix though, try Intermittent Fasting and running.",0
17907,"If you're going to be bulking, chances are you will add a bit of fat as well as muscle, if you do it right. 
 You could add in a couple of cardio sessions between your other sessions which will help you keep your body fat down.

As far as bulking goes, it's all about what you eat, if you eat a shit ton of sugary and fatty foods, you'll add alot of fat. Do some research on Lean Bulking, eat good whole foods, make sure protein intake is good and cut the sugar out completely.  Between this and the cardio, you won't add significant fat on your bulk.",0
17908,This isn't helpful for 99% of people ... Only because they can't do it lol. This is advanced and pretty impressive.,0
17909,"In my experience, a heavy intense strength session on one day is paired best with a lesser intensity cardio session.  If I were you, I'd just alternate ABABAB. If you want to add in an extra strength training session, I'd pair it so I'm doing Push/Pull on one day and Legs on the other.

Same concept. You’re typically so focused on the exercise at hand that you’re preoccupied with counting down down time, steps, calories, etc. However, when you’re preoccupied with something while exercising, time just flies by.

I did this a lot when I had taken science labs, particularly for anatomy. Memorizing and reviewing structures while on the elliptical, treadmill, or bike made time go by a lot faster because studying takes up so much time compared to counting down how many minutes you have left, comparing it to how many minutes you’ve already done, and thinking to yourself, “so I just gotta tun that long three more times.”",0

17941,"Yeah I get your point, it’s just the scales are the actual evidence that you are losing weight. But I agree with you and others have said the same - measure myself! Thanks man!",0
17942,"There are a number of studies that show running is highly effective for losing weight, but not fat.  That is, running tends to result in lower scale numbers, but no change in waist circumference or fat free mass (unless it is combined with strength training).  There is a lot less research on swimming as an intervention, but my guess is that you are more likely to keep or even gain some muscle, while slowly losing body fat.

Of course, the real answer to this is: stop the using the scale.  It's the worst metric for success you could imagine (unless you are morbidly obese).  Try belt size instead if you are a man, or how pants fit your hips if a woman.",0
17943,"Yeah I just read some other guys reply that swimming builds muscle as opposed to burning fat which I suppose, in the long term, is the goal! 

It’s just that the scales obviously reflect the amount of weight lost, but if you think it’s still good to be doing what I’m doing this way then awesome! It was just a bit depressing to see (on the scale) no results, but great idea about measuring myself! I’ve also taken photos that I’ll update each month to compare! That will probably show the difference! 

Thanks for your help!",0

17949,"I don’t know if this is relative. I subluxed my SC joint due to dyskinesia in my lower trap and serratus. It was weird I was training great making good progress then I got very sick, I attempted to train instead of easing back and strained rotator cuff muscles then got sick again. I was laid up not eating much and unaware of my weight drop. When I went back in I wasn’t patient and subluxed my SCJ. This created a looseness in the joint, weird inflammation, costochondritis, a subclavius dysfunction, and slight scapular winging. No one wanted to work with me. I got lucky finding a physio who would and actually took the time to see my mobility. It’s been 3 years of building back to function and muscular and strength symmetry. After working with a good physio and doing my own constant research to dive in deep with him, we systematically worked each issue out. Testing strength endurance and coordination before progressing. I found through them and my new experiences that muscular imbalances are common. That as long as the imbalances aren’t creating pain and messing with performance they are not a big deal. Most pro athletes show imbalances, and the best elite athletes have adapted to their imbalances. I have trained back to being on the ice more than I have in the past 3 years, lifting with naturally good form, back to doing pull ups, and feeling strength in places I never felt so much before....but my serratus and middle trap still look a tad smaller on 1 side. Though it’s just as strong as the other if not stronger. I guess you can always throw in some 1 sided closed-chain exercises like single leg squats holding a suspension trainer or something like that. Get creative. The one thing I’ll say is being creative with your exercises and throwing your muscle memory off can help tremendously in your case if it’s purely a mobility reason. Maybe find a physio who can watch you walk, run, jump and whatever they may want to see to perhaps diagnose if it’s your mobility or musculature. Everyone is different and it is possible your ligaments/tendons were formed differently on one side. My physio even showed me he had an extra ligament in his bicep.

17958,"Yes, I have the same problem. Part of the reason, I suspect, is that my body is not habituated to high intensity cardio like that (I'm very fit and do lots of sports, but I recently took up spinning and it's a whole other level of cardio for me). As others have mentioned, I make sure to drink plenty of water before, during and after a cardio session. But what seems to have resolved the issue is what I eat after cardio. I noticed the headaches are very painful and intense if I eat a healthy, low-fat meal. So now after my cardio sessions, I eat a very fatty, very salty, high protein &amp; high calorie meal. I don't have a headache at all after! Of course, this is an anecdotal solution, but you should try it and see if that helps, because being stuck in bed with a splitting headache all day after a cardio session is no picnic.",0

There is always someone with a better body or in better shape than you. Also, most people aren’t there to flex and show off. And don’t assume everyone who is there is loving every second of it either. Working out is hard and a challenge- it’s sucks when you feel like your workout was a flop but nothing feels better than nailing something you had no idea you could do! 

Also group fitness was a game changer for me.  Something about sweating along with everybody else makes it more fun and makes me want to push myself further. I also keep trying new things- I’m loving hot yoga and spin right now. I too have depression, part of getting out of a rut is forcing yourself to do things you don’t want to do. I  do understand if maybe the gym environment makes your depression worse or if it’s your own self destructive thoughts (I suck so much, I’m so out of shape, I’m too lazy to ever make this a habit, I can’t even do a burpee, etc)Don’t give up on the idea of exercise. I really don’t think it’s the exercise part that’s the problem. Maybe start at home, start slower, get rid of any expectations of yourself you have. Pretend you are a slug with and every rep, every effort is a milestone. Celebrate every finished workout and challenge yourself to go further next time. There are some great you tube exercise videos.

In fact, you can do something like 5 or 10 floors every hour or maybe 10-20 floors every other hour, or something along these lines. The point is that most of us who work out do one big workout per day, which is great, but upping our activity throughout the day is hugely beneficial to health and fitness, and I would do just the right amount that is short of getting sweaty. You shouldn’t have to really break a major sweat if at work. People believe that in order to work out effectively, one needs to get to the point of being really out of breath, etc., but frequency and total volume of movements are also really important. Doing 30-80 flights of stairs in a day is great even if it’s broken up into many small chunks (maybe even better if broken up).",0

Cardio with body weight exercises will help. You can do logs with your kettle bells - kettle bell swings, squat holding the bell, russian twists with the bell, etc.

These are all around 20mins long, easy to fit into your day, with minimal equipment. Check Facebook Marketplace or other sites for dumbbells - people are always selling them! Even just some 8's, 10's or 12's would be good for lateral raises, flys, etc.",0

If you are working out, but eating trash, you’re going to feel like trash. Make sure you’re drinking a ton of WATER, and getting good, nutrient dense food, free of oils and processed sugars. 

Also make sure you aren’t taking on more than you can handle. Setting standards too high in the beginning will lead you to fail, thus feeling bad about yourself. Start slow and ease into things. Health isn’t something you can always jump into hammer down.",0

18010,"In my opinion, you're feeling the lack of energy from cutting out caffeine/energy drinks. You could pick them back up and see how you do. 

If they don't agree with you, no prob. But the strong likelihood is that you'll need some form of stimulant to feel energized through the day. 

Caffeine is the #1 consumed drug on planet earth for a reason. (And it's actually pretty good for you.) Alternatives include rhodiola, ginseng, or other stimulating herbs. (Safe ones only, pls.)

But, imo, don't feel bad if you need a stimulant- Humans aren't really optimally adapted to our current environment. No predators. We don't hunt our own food. Screens. Climate control. 

So, evolutionarily, in such an environment why be going at 100% energy all the time? 'Nap, bro!' Says the brain. 

But since most people don't want to be droopy all afternoon...

Fish, chicken, beef, Tofu, soymilk, tempeh, etc. Can you get or make those?  lots of asian households use soymilk makers in the kitchen, a handy appliance that pays for itself.  A quart of soymilk is like 35grams of protein. Add a few tablespoons of peanut butter in addition to that and you'll get the same amount of protein as a ribeye steak. tempeh is really easy to make at home too.",0

It is heavily based on brute strength, balance, and precise technique. Roped climbing is often easier, but generally longer. It is thus a little more endurance based. I would rather do a roped climb on a ""rest"" day than go bouldering on a ""rest"" day, if that makes sense. If you start with bouldering, only do the really easy ones. Its actually super easy to pull a muscle or tendon if you start climbing too hard, even if you are in really good shape.",0

18043,"Make sure your getting enough vitamins and water as mentioned already. Vitamin D and B for example may make a noiticable difference when it comes to energy levels.

I would recommend adding a multi vitamin, oils and even a adrenal booster to your daily routine. Do your research when it comes to these items, however, and use liquid/oils or powdered vitamin capsules from quality producers. Alot of vitamin brands are poor quality and solid pills can apparently be more difficult to digest and can be less effective than powder/oils.

There is lots of research surrounding vitamins and their long term effectiveness or lack there of. When it comes to energy levels and health read up on what may or may not work for you and experiment to see if these have a positive effect on your daily energy levels! 

I also know that after taking a blend of greens powder/algae and Vega powder (lots of veggies) I feel great. I notice a significant difference in how quick my thinking is/my attention span and how lazy I am when compared to days I don't take them.

Here are a few brands/products to look into if your interested:

Progressive - Vegetable capsules
Preferred Nutrition - AdrenaSense
Natures Answer - D3 drops
Amazing Grass - Green Superfood
Vega - Plant based protein and greens
Organika - Spirulina

Supplements can be expensive and there are plenty of other life choices you can make to increase energy as well!

- Quality sleep habits/routine
- Meditation
- Exercise and stretching
- Cold showers
- Routine prior to starting activities for example, a good healthy morning routine can help you mentally and physically prepare for the day
- Eating the right portions at the right time along with quality of food and quantity

Unless you've had serious trauma (car accident, Nanck Kerrigan) or serious disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis) you probably have weak quads- which cause knee pain, often runner's knee. ('Becoming a Supple Leopard' talks about this in the first couple of pages- most body pain is mechanical.)

If you have no serious knee issues, I would take stairs often and to just when theu start to hurt. Then stop. If you get mild knee pain, take ibuprofen and come back to do it again in a couple days. 

Eventually your knees will stop hurting and your legs will get strong.

18068,"I don't know the specifics of the reasons you feel the way you do, but I'll share some of my experience in hopes that you can gain something from it. 

I went to an all girls high school. When it came time to go to the locker room to get changed, the girls would just change in front of everyone. I, went to the stall to change. I wouldn't say I was ashamed of how I looked, but I wasn't comfortable being so vulnerable. 

Fast forward many years later. I love being active, I was bored, and I wanted to try something new. I signed up for pole dancing classes. And wow, I fell in love with it. The girls all help you feel comfortable with your body. You might feel weak at first, but you get strong pretty damn fast. Your focus becomes trying to figure out how to make pretty shapes (art) with your own body. It will make you happy and it will make you sad, but that'll be because you love it and you want to be the best at it. 

Again, this is my story. But the goal is to find something you love. Maybe once that happens you can revisit the gym.

My other suggestion, since you mentioned how it's having an impact on your relationship... If you still prefer to try to go to the gym, maybe try to simulate some of the exercises in a place you're most comfortable. That way your mind can associate the two eventually. 

I put on noise canceling over the ear headphones and turn on energy pumping music so I feel like I'm at the gym by myself.

I hope you find what works best for you.",0

However, I agree with the above comment that adding some muscular mass to the arm help it appear more natural. Be aware though that you are ADDING mass, and though it will look more natural (the ‘arm flap’ will likely begin to appear smaller) the overall size of your arm may increase.

2- you have x amount of time to see how many of y exercise and w exercise you can do. At the end of time x, how much did you get done?

Today, you did task based. How long did it take you for that task? Could you have done more? Log your workout. Next time you do it, you can see how much more you did. Consider today a baseline. Some days you have a task planned out, but you can’t handle all of it, or could hurt yourself if you try to make yourself do it and then sacrifice good form for performance. If you’re hurt, you can’t train. Go hard. Beat the clock. Bey yourself’s performance on the workout last time. Do more task, use less time. Either way, you are making progress. Hope that helps.

Then you actually ‘start’ your workout with 5 reps at 65%, 5 reps at 75%, 5+ reps at 85% and 25 reps of 65%

18165,"First things first- enjoy yourself!  Spend some time on the machines that have little pictures on the side of how to use them. You cant really go wrong or hurt yourself on these as long as you pay attention to what your body is telling you.

If you want to get bigger/stronger you need to be mostly focusing on compound lifts. These are things like deadlifts, squats, bench press and overhead/military press. These can be dangerous if performed with bad form or incorrect technique. Best thing you could do is talk to a trainer at the gym for an introduction. Most gyms do these for free if you are a new member. 

Also Jeff Nippard does a great series on youtube called technique Tuesday where he goes deeper into how to perform the majority of these movements. 

You might also find some friendly people in the gym that can give you tips. Most people are pretty approachable if you are interested and genuinely want to learn( just be prepared to listen to 25 minutes of explanations before you get started)

As for rest days, it's hard not doing something but you can do something active. I preferred a simple yoga flow for about 30 minutes to an hour, or 30 minutes then 15 minutes of additional stretching and balancing, or breathing exercises. So if you think about it, you can look at it as training hard for 6 days and then 1 day of just taking it easy. Scheduling this I would say on your most tiresome day, set it as a rest day. If you're still struggling, get a notebook and note down your daily activity, and after a while you see a pattern.

Maybe consult a personal trainer or someone at a gym to show you proper form or help progress you because muscle actually helps burn fat and support your body.,0

18240,"So I’m 5 months into working out I started out August 10 2019. I’ve been successfully working out 3 to 5 times a week. I’ve lost 25 lbs. the thing that has got me going in the beginning is motivation videos on YouTube that lasted like 3 weeks. Just YouTube motivation work out videos and you will get some great motivation. But it dies out so you get a quote that really sticks out to you and repeat it like my favorite from lance armstrong. “Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever. “ I usually look for motivational Medal of Honor stories since I am a ex marine it really helps I research motivation as if I’m researching work outs. Eventually you work out enough that your reflection of your self in the mirror is your motivation.  People need to get their mind on track so getting into yoga making play list every, actively talking to others like this and asking questions really helps out. Get into more forums and look at others progress pictures set short term goals instead of long term goals. People don’t see the the results they want cause working out and results some times takes a long time so it demotivates.  Sign up for 5ks cause you have to pay for them and since you pay you feel obligated to finish them.",0

At the same time, if you’re not getting pain from it and you’re happy with your progression and efficiency, I don’t see a need to change how you run, unless you want to really dive into the mechanics of it. In which case professional assessment/coaching would probably give you everything you need",0

18253,"First, congrats on the weight loss that is a huge accomplishment and you should be proud of yourself.

As for motivation, I try to set a goal or a desire that helps me to start motivated and then I do small random things  to help with each workout. For a big goal I try to do more than just ""being healthy"", I try to make it something tangible, like : I want to run a marathon for 2021 or be able to do a spartan race for the summer or to hit a new PR. Setting goals like this I have found make me inspired to go to the gym.

As for the smaller motivations, I try to do silly things like pick out my gym outfit (something that makes me feel like a badass in the gym or something I love), I try to reward myself for hitting mini goals (like I am down 2 lbs for example) in the form of a cheat meal or buying an item of clothing or whatever you like. I also try to make a playlist that makes me pumped to hit the gym.

You can also try going with a friend. Sometime the accountability alone is motivation to go. If you don't have a friend, you can also try a class which forces you to go.

Sometimes you have to go deep and just go when you don't have any motivation. It is a slow process. You will have good days and bad days. One step at a time.

Working out has improved my overall mood, reduced anxiety, boosted my confidence, and helped me sleep better. Bonus perk: a year ago I couldn’t do a full push-up. I can now do ~20, which I think is pretty cool :)",0

The other machines like Bioelectrical Impedance to check your body fat are more inaccurate than the Dexa scan.

18268,planks work different parts of yours abs. Mainly the ones holding your organs inside so the deep ones.

Pretty sure i'm right about everything i said. most people working out don't do direct ab work, most people working out have abs. Must be steroids. Cant remember the last time i looked at a workout routine and saw "" 2 min plank"" ""40 leg raises"" ""core day""

18280,"seems like a serious issue... You should talk to him about it and tell him how it makes you feel. There's a lot of other ways to stay healthy. The goal is to find something you enjoy and stick to it. If you like jogging in the morning outside then that could be it , if you like dancing then that could be it , yoga , martial arts, rock climbing. I mean there's endless of fun physical activities to do.  

At the same time i want you to know that no one cares how thin you are at the gym. If you stick to the gym and lift for a few months the issue will start to fade away as you notice improvements in your body. If how thin you are is the only problem then that will easily change with time :)

&amp;#x200B;

a simple tip i can give you is to stick with it for 3 months and if you don't feel any different after that then you should quit and find another activity. Another tip is to put on  your happy playlist. If you don't have one , create a music playlist and listen to it when you're having a good time. Traveling ,walking around , fun time with ur bf ;). And then use the same playlist when you're working out. It shoudl trick your brain into feeling better. This is a trick to help with depression in general :)",0
18281,"i'd love to see a picture of you in 10% body fat. Something tells me you're not \^\^'.  People tend to overestimate how low their body fat actually is...

if you don't brace yuor core while doing these exercises then ofc your abs won't work but if yuo're doing the compound exercises correctly yuo should have enough stimilus to work yuor abs.  This has been said and proven by many experts who never do direct ab work and have abs.. You might just have bad ab genetics. Some people have 4 abs not 6.  You def don't need a whole lot of ab work. Some people dedicate 2 days a week for cardio and abs and i just feel like thats wasted as you can do cardio on your rest day and abs after a push or pull day. 

&amp;#x200B;

bottom line. The majority of people don't need direct ab work. Abs are prob the most worked muscle in the body. And really they don't take a lot to grow. If you do them twice a week for a month you'll see a huge change. My abs are strong from doing tae kwan do and just hopping in place for an hour... i don't think thats direct ab work.

Don't worry about ""holding water"" - it's mostly a myth. That's what I've come to believe after studying dietetics. Water is your friend, according to some ideally we'd be drinking about a gallon a day but who wants to live in the bathroom.

That being said, when we lose fat it gets transformed into water and CO2 so we breath it, sweat it and pee it out. So I suppose that from that perspective, if you have fat you want to lose then technically you're holding water.

For a healthy body, you should always drink heaps of water, eat fibres, sleep well - aprox. 15 cups for men and 11 cups for women (again, the recommended amount varies a lot but I found that I feel best when I stick with this as opposed to 8 cups). As for fibres, 20 to 30 grams a day is advised and you get that from fruit, veggies, cereals. It's surprisingly hard to get that much so check the labels. Eat food that's processed less - less mistery ingredients.

18289,"Just wanted to share a proud moment for me on Reddit.

11 years ago, I tore my ACL. I went through surgery and rehab to get myself at 100%. While my body “felt” fine, in the back of my head I carried a lot of doubt and fear of squatting.

Since I started going to the gym consistently about 6 years ago, I’ve always wanted to see an increase in strength. Albeit, still struggling mightily on my bench, I’ve dedicated the last two years getting myself over the mental jump of squatting heavy.

I started squatting at least 2-3x a week. My main focus was form - I had to trust myself and that my knee had a full range of motion. Slowly but surely, I started increasing in weight. I no longer struggled with 225, then 275 then 315.

In May of 2019, I hit a new PR of 345 and holy shit was I proud - but I wanted more. I knew I had to continue improving my body overall. I implemented pause squats, hip thrusters to ensure my body was strong enough to reach new heights (I also followed a very solid training program). Leading up to my 405, I’ve never even attempted 350+ up. So needless to say, I was nervous af. While the 405 wasn’t the cleanest, knowing I was able to accomplish this milestone is huge. For those interested, I made a video on my squat journey: https://youtu.be/bWg4JNqFrkw

TL;DR - 11 years ago, I tore my ACL. Took me a while to get over the mental hump, but I hit a 405 squat!",0

You will need to prepare by working up your hiking to 4-5 hours. I would do running and stair climbing along with weight training to help me orepare. And of course hiking as much as you can.

I preface with that knowledge because now I’m gaining weight again, but it’s mainly fat. I started doing Calisthenics at home and then joined a gym nearby. I do exercises that I find “fun” and fruitful. There are tons of “gym rats” and fitness researchers on YouTube that have great information. Obviously don’t take the word of everyone on the Internet, but do look for reputable people and learn some things you might want to try on your own. If that seems too difficult and you can afford it, get a trainer to kick start your workouts and then you’ll build knowledge from someone who has proper knowledge.

18347,"Hello there. 

You should start to lift some more weight in the gym. Some common misconceptions I hear from parents are:
1. It'll stunt growth. In actuality, lifting weights through puberty may actually help the body acclimate better to the change, it doesn't stunt growth but will help develop stronger bones. 
2. Unsafe.  My general rule is this, if the client has body control, can move well, and isn't told otherwise by a healthcare professional, they should be able to lift weights.  Toddlers squat, hinge, and press at a very young age, people should be doing more of it.
3. ""Bad for muscles."" I don't actually know where this idea has stemmed from, but I have heard it from a few different parents.  It's nonsense, as long as you're following a sound program, weight training is very good for the body. 

If that all fails and you're still bound to treadmills, try increasing speed and incline. Do intervals of sprints with jogging to help improve the muscular endurance of the legs, and find some bars at school or the park to do some pullups, do pushups, and some body weight squats. 

Eat a lot.  You're going to be growing, and you've already stated you're skinny. Eat a ton of healthy food and you'll like the results. 

Good luck my friend.",0

I see many people complaining that their weight didn't change, as if nothing changed. That's so not the case.

I'd say figure out your goal (muscle gain? weight loss?) first. From there you can search what to do to get there. 

Oh, going to a professional has to be mentioned here, since you might do some exercise wrong and get injured.",0

18396,"Cardio helps with my anxiety. Don't get me wrong I still have the occasional attack, but it's not at all as bad as what is was. Plus it gives me time to process things when I'm too exhausted to argue with myself... so I accept things better and move on. Good luck!",0
18397,"NEVER EVER TOO LATE! And your progress so far is fucking awesome!! I'm genuinely excited for you, it's so great that you're recruiting support in all these aspects!!!!! You're already ON the path to getting fit &amp; strong, you are already doing it so now you just gotta keep it going!

You didn't mention nutrition, so I just wanted to add that it's very important. Recovery is important too, don't push yourself too hard, take rest days, and protect your sleep!

18400,"It doesn’t matter how old you are. I’ve seen people in their 60s get more fit than people in their 20s. And they never exercised their entire lives. Small changes like just walking, doing a little resistance training and eating slightly healthier will all make a big difference. Just slowly incorporate more as you go. You don’t have to start by going all in on a hard, high level workout routine. Start small and work your way up.",0
18401,"Absolutely! I worked my ass off for a year to get in shape, not just be thin. I can't control that part.  But I can and have learned to control a healthier life. I had a heart attack at 32 from being lazy. I was five seven and 125lb. It was my laziness, horrible diet, heavy smoking and overall neglect that gave me a heart attack at 32. I had triple bypass sugery. 
I decided, after I grasped what was going on, to never be that way again. I quit smoking, talked with a nutritionist about my diet, slooowly began working out. Don't drink pop anymore. Rarely drink alcohol. I am 38, the same size I've been since I was 16. But I'm healthy! Doctor is fully happy with the changes I've made and fought for. 
It took me a year to fully change my lifestyle. I had stumbles and trips. Absolutely! I'm human, and so are you. But, and this is major, I never gave up on myself. I learned to like me.

I feel terrible. I graduate in May and want to get in shape.",0
18404,Sorry one more thing to add... it may help in keeping your back straight to focus more on keeping your chest up and shoulders back and your back will stay straight as a result it's easier to focus on those things as cues to posture.... a wider stance might also be helpful,0
18405,I would practice this form without weight and also try an exercise called a 'Goblet Squat' with a kettlebell or dumbbell because i feel that is an exercise that promotes good squat form in general.... while i would agree that your back should stay straight and knees shouldn't go outward i wouldn't try forcing these things so far that you loose balance that seems like an exaggerated posture. Squats and all exercises should feel like you're in a more or less comfortable posture. Some flexibility work and stretching in your hamstrings and around your hips might help this feel mor natural as well,0
18406,"By “effective,” well, it depends on your goals. Want to build core muscle strength?  Planking is great!  Want to lose tons of weight?  Eh, not really. I means, it will help build muscle (which in general helps burn calories) but if you want to lose weight, you gotta burn more calories than you eat. This means normally cardio (walking, running, swimming, biking). 

And of course, “you can’t outrun a bad diet,” meaning that if you’re eating a ton of junk (lots of calories), it’s going to be really hard to lose weight, even if you’re exercising a lot.   Seriously. Look up how many calories are in your favorite meal/snack food. Then look up how long you would have to run/walk/whatever to burn that same amount of calories. Keep this in mind. 

If you want to add in cardio, try a program like “Couch to 5k.”  It helps you build up to running a 5k, but in a sane and healthy way. Many have success with it— see r/C25K",0
18407,Have you tried this? Does it work for you?,0
18408,I’m not sure if it’s a posture thing. My boyfriend says my knees are going inward when they should be going outward and my back goes forward when it should be straight. But if I lean back and open my knees up I fall backward. I can’t hold myself up in that position and I think that’s the biggest problem,0
18409,"Put your back against a wall and use that to support your weight when squatting. Voila, assisted squats.",0
18410,"Not at all! I highly recommend following these 3 people for incorporating a healthy sustainable fitness level into your life: BJ Gaddour, Jeremy Scott, and Brett Contreras. 

Honestly do this for 52 weeks a year x however long you live and you’ll be happy —&gt; 2 days a week full body circuits, 1 upper body resistance day, 1 lower body resistance day. 

You have to find a sustainable way to adhere to your “fitness” and not just go all out for the first two months of a year and then revert back. That’s what 99% of people do when trying to make healthy changes. You have to take a long term approach which isn’t inherently easy. People overestimate what they can achieve in 3 months and underestimate what they can achieve in 3-5 years. 

I’ve been following this way of thinking for awhile now thanks to BJ Gaddour and Jeremy Scott, I live a pretty normal life where it isn’t fully consumed by fitness, am social, and still look lean/muscular/abs without sacrificing my bigger goal of quality of life. It’s a balance.",0
18411,Yes. Plain and simple. It’s all relative on what you’ll perceive as successful and the more you want “it” the tougher “it” will be. But it will be worth it for more reasons than you can imagine. Congrats on taking the first steps to a fun journey of a healthy lifestyle!,0
18412,"That would depend on what you mean by not being able to do one with proper form. It is likely that you should be working to strengthen the muscles in your quads, hamstrings and glutes in order to just lift more weight.
if your form is breaking down while you're trying to up the weight you could either be trying to lift too much weight that you aren't ready for yet or you may have some imbalances or lack of flexibility. Those imbalances may also be due to one of the three muscle groups i mentioned above being much weaker than the others.",0
18413,"Howdy.  It is possible to lose weight and be more fit, at any age.  I am 67 and have lost almost 20 pounds in the last 3 months simply by eating less food and exercising more.  I walk 2 miles each morning but began adding another 3 miles each afternoon by walking at a great park we have in our city.  I eat a normal breakfast and lunch but for dinner have only an apple (I love these apples called Envy, very sweet and crunchy) a small piece of cheese, and some nuts.  That gives me some protein that I need.  I have consistently lost weight with this routine.  I hope you are able to achieve your goals.  With a positive outlook, I think it is definitely possible.",0
18414,"It's absolutely possible and you can do it!

There is one and only one trick to ""get fit and strong"" and that's consistency. Consistency in diet and activity levels. Once you make a change and stick to it for a couple months it becomes habit and it will feel more weird to skip a day exercising than not.",0
18415,My ideal is to workout everyday. If I feel terrible I’ll take a day off. My workouts are scaled down to support that. Going for x days per week is logical but for me I would workout too hard and take too many days off due to soreness.   I’m trying to workout everyday and lose weight without soreness.,0

I've gone from absolute coach potatoe to doing sports every day just like that. It's a bit frustrating in the beginning because you don't have a whole lot of muscle mass but that is a problem that will vanish over time.

The most important thing you wanna consider is finding a sport that makes you happy because otherwise you might consider it a punishment.

If you’re looking for a better routine (and something longer than 15 min is probably a good idea), try r/bodyweightfitness, the sub has a recommended routine in the “about” section that many start with.

18429,"I have found that exercise greatly helps with my anxiety and depression. It is not a cure all and it won’t fix all of your problems but it can help. When I don’t work out regularly, I find that both of them get worse because it can be a time or release and not having to think about anything but just moving forward. I would first figure out what kind of exercise you love or what feels the best for your body! I love walking hills on the treadmill, going on the elliptical, hiking, and I am a dancer so I get a workout and relief from stress from that as well. Then when you figure out what you like doing establishing a routine and honoring that time that you take to do something for yourself is really important. Some days it’ll be hard to be motivated to work out and do things and you don’t have to do it all the time, but for me having that designated time of the day where it is only about me, and putting one foot in-front of the other and accomplishing something is important. I hope my ten cents helped a little. keep on keeping on, you got this!",0

18432,"I promise you it's possible.  Our bodies can get really out of shape if we don't care of ourselves, but they are also amazingly adaptable and respond to constant stress.  

Five years ago I was in terrible shape--overfat (almost 200lbs at 5'10""), had two spinal procedures, was in constant pain--my gf at the time left me because and was already old at 48.  I started to eat less, but also let better quality food, cut way back on drinking, and started training.  I started doing high intensity interval raining (HIIT) for fat loss and metabolic fitness, and bought an olympic bar and bumper plates.  I think I started with 135lbs deadlifting, and that was painful and exhausting.

It took years of not taking care of myself to get unfit, and it took years of steady work to change.  There were some results faster--I lost a lot of fat over maybe 3 months. But building up my strength and becoming muscular and fit took longer: on my 53rd birthday, 5 years after starting my fitness journey, I finally pulled 500lbs one rep max.  This is my five year [before and after](https://imgur.com/I6731sH).

I'm fit enough to compete in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with agues in their 20s and 30s, and strong enough that I am now competing in powerlifting.  I promise you, if you train correctly (not just be active, although active is good), eat well, and are consistent, you can become hella fit.",0
18433,"I have been doing cardio consistently, by choice, at least 2-3 days a week, for about 8 weeks now. Usually 3 days a week. (The lesser weeks were the holidays.) This is the longest I’ve ever stuck with working out in my life. I’ve thought about it recently, wondering what was different this time, why I’m so motivated, why I keep doing it. My life in general hasn’t changed much: I still have family stuff (married, got an 8yo daughter), work (full-time), and everything else that occupies my time. All the things I always said made it so I didn’t have time to work out. So what’s different now? Why am I making the time?

My daughter does afterschool daycare with our local YMCA, so we get “free” memberships at the Y. My husband likes the gym (or at least he likes having it available), so we both got our memberships all set up so we could both go.

I KNEW my history. I had NO expectations that I would keep going. I knew I might go once in a blue moon (when I felt like I had time,) do the elliptical, and come back in a few weeks.

I used to beat myself up over this but I guess I just stopped, knowing there were more interesting things in life I could beat myself up for these days haha.

Well, around Nov I started losing my hair. Not balding, just losing 20-25 strands at a time, like I did after having my daughter (body’s stress response.)

I realized that I was just constantly anxious and stressed (in spite of therapy and meds) to the point where it was normal to me to feel this way, these knots in my stomach, etc. I KNEW I needed to start taking better care of me, even just bathing more often and changing clothes more often...instead I rarely did ANYTHING for myself because I was always so scared that my family or work would come down on me for not doing enough, being available 24/7. I also knew in the back of my mind that this wasn’t true, that they all loved and appreciated me and would HELP me make time for myself if I asked, and at the very least would support me and be happy for me if I started find the time. But I didn’t trust it.

One day I was like...listen. I need to do one thing to take care of me. I KNOW exercise has its benefits. I am just so scared that if I go spend an hour at the gym, someone will need me (at work maybe) and later come down on me for not being available enough. But I’ll never learn to trust that this is NOT the case until I take the risk.

So I went and worked out. I got on the elliptical. My neck and shoulders were tight so I focused on relaxing them as much as I could and just using my (weak from sitting all the time) legs. I told myself I don’t have to come back. I told myself I could do whatever I wanted on this thing. I told myself I don’t have to push or challenge myself. This isn’t about that. This is just about being here and doing what feels good. If it doesn’t feel good, I don’t have to do it.  This is about my mental health: this is about the benefits of exercise for anxiety. I am going to move and get all this energy and adrenaline out, just GO and get it out.

At the time, I had been having a lot of stress with my mom. I was on the elliptical, going, and whispering very quietly to myself: “I am not my mom. I am not my mom. I am not my mom.” 

I got off the elliptical after 30 mins and felt...kinda high. You know, the runner’s high. Later, I noticed during the day that the things that usually bothered me or made me mad...didn’t affect me AS much. The feelings were not as intense. 

The next time I went back, it was because I wanted that again. I actually felt like I needed it. I didn’t want to feel that way anymore: anxious, beating myself up for not doing enough all the time, either for myself or others. Sad, off and on. Not as much joy as I knew I should have. Exercise dampened all those feelings. The endorphins were like drugs that lasted through the day. And if I still got sad about something during the day I exercised, I could always say, “Hey. At least I exercised today.” It made me feel good about me. 

8 weeks later and I’m still going. My shoulder and back pain have dramatically decreased. My performance has gotten better. It makes me SO proud of me. I listen to music that makes me happy and inspires me. And you know what? That hour or so I’m at the gym...no one can get to me. No one can ask me for anything. No one. Because I’m not home and I’m not at my computer for work. Other people are taking care of things for me for that hour. They’re doing it because they love me. I am loved, by others and by myself. The stronger and more capable I become, I see it as a metaphor for the inner work I’ve done through the years. My outsides, my strength, it’s matching it. I don’t give a shit about how I look, I really don’t. This is just about my body matching my mind. 

And even now, as I work out, I always tell myself, if it sucks and you’re not having fun right now, slow down. You’re allowed to do that. You don’t have to bust ass for this to matter. Yet every time I am pushing myself, sometimes with a smile on my face as I listen to my favorite music and think...I’m doing this. Shit, damn, wow, I’m doing this.

The mix of cardio, hitting things, and the social element has seriously done wonders! Great stress relief and I’ve made a bunch of new friends. Boxfit is now the part of my day that I look forward to the most. Definitely recommend giving something like that a go!

18445,"This really depends on where you're at and where your depression comes from. For me, I was situationally depressed after the 2008 fiscal collapse. I felt despair over my own career prospects, and let that define who I was at the time. Weight lifting really helped me for two reasons. First, and especially in the beginning, I was able to lift more (weight or reps or sets--whatever) and that sense of progress helped me feel like I was getting better. Second, getting stronger and bigger helped me feel more masculine and powerful, which was important after the emasculating experience of being unable to find a job.

I'd maybe slow it down a bit and see if you can stretch it out a little more. It really depends what your goals are. But if your goal is overall fitness, I'd say you should try to maximize your total distance traveled. 

Idk what kind of time you have to dedicate to running but maybe try to go like 30-45 minutes at a little bit slower speed. As you get in better shape, you will go further and further distances in the same amount of time.",0

If you can keep up at that level for a while, I don't see an issue. The problem is that it's typically more beneficial to run for, say, 30 minutes at 85% max than to run for 2 minutes at 100% max.",0

18505,"What’s going on everyone. I wanted to share a quick guide for those interested in starting a diet. 

Whether this is your first time going on a diet or just looking to cut down. The principles listed below hold true prior to starting any diet for any length of time. 

1. Always Plan ahead

The key to any diet is proper planning. Listed below are some of the key essentials to ensure you plan ahead. 

- Weigh In and Realistic Goal Setting
- What kind of diet will you be on? (Doesn’t matter if it’s Keto, etc - as long as you can do something that keeps you consistent)
- Understanding your maintenance calories and caloric deficit 
- If you want to go a step further, calculate your macros. There are plenty of free tools online. I will link a few below.

https://www.iifym.com/macro-calculator/
https://www.transparentlabs.com/pages/calculator
https://www.transparentlabs.com/pages/calculator

DONT skip this step. The diet is the most important aspect to your weight loss journey. 

Lastly, find yourself a training program you can follow and would enjoy. Whether it’s a 3,4, or 5 day split, as long it keeps you active, that’s most important. 

2. Food 

I don’t mean to beat a dead horse but the diet is the most important aspect of your weight loss journey. 

There are many ways you can go about food. You can order through a meal plan service but I highly recommend you prepare your own food. Meal prep allows you to be sure you know what you are cooking with and what is actually going into the food. 

When it comes the food you should be buying, I recommend the following for protein:
- Lean beef
- Poultry
- Fish
- Eggs
- Beans
- Soy

When it comes to carbs, I suggest you try and steer away from simple carbs. Now keep in mind not all carbs are created equal. 

Simple carbs you should be consuming are fruits, vegetables, etc. Keep in mind, food that contain processed sugar are considered simple carbs so try and steer clear of sodas, sweets, etc. Its ok to have cravings, it’ll happen naturally. If you do have a craving, try to pick a healthier alternative that wont throw you off the shits. 

Now for the carbs that are going to keep you satiated and help you stay full during your caloric deficit. My recommendation is to the following:

- Potatoes
- Oats
- Rice

Potatoes and Oats in particular, are high in volume and low in carb which is great for a weight loss. 

Ultimately, you don’t need to be super limiting when it comes to food. You can have the little things you enjoy but it comes down to balance and maintaining a caloric deficit. 

3. Training

When it comes to the gym and training, if you want to put on some muscle or preserve muscle, weight training is highly recommended. If you simply care about losing weight or improving your overall health, then weight training is definitely not necessary.  Something as simple as going on a run or power walk can be equally effective in burning calories. 

When it comes to weight training, there are plenty of different ways to train. This isn’t a exhaustive list but you get the jist:

- Full Body Splits
- Push / Pull Splits
- CrossFit
- HIIT

Ultimately, the choice is yours. As long as you are burning more calories than you eat, you are on the right track. 

TL;DR - Best way to set yourself up for success for a diet is by preparing ahead of time (know how many calories you need to consume to be in a caloric deficit &amp; how you plan to exercise). When it comes to food - buy lean proteins, eat more of complex carbs, and healthy fats. Training is up to you. If you want to preserve or put on some muscle, then I do suggest do some weight training. I also made a video for those of you interested: https://youtu.be/TEnn5ntaS3c",0

18517,Thanks for sharing your picture and your words.  You are an inspiration.  I am 67 and walk 5 miles a day as well as do some moderate work with weights.  You are right that age is not a factor.  It is the mindset we have.  Keep up the good work.,0

18519,oh god its a threesome.,0
18520,"It's like you say, there is more to exercise and staying healthy than training just for aesthetics, and aesthetics is at the bottom of my list. I train to be able to run, sprint, endure, react, bent over, crawl, jump, pull up, and so on. How big my muscles are is the least of my worries. Throwing the kettlebell up is not just to look cool, which is what a lot of people think, yes it looks cool, but that's not the objective, there is a whole lot of control required to make the kettlebell go where you want it to go and then there is the benefit of increased proprioception which is something vital for fighters (I'm a rusty Purple Belt in BJJ). There are a lot of people that don't understand and just say silly stuff because they only know one thing and only have one thing on their mind, and I've discovered (or rather rediscovered) that Reddit is not the place to try and help educate people/trolls/keyboardwarriors that think they're *experts at everything*. I'd post a video/link where I explain things about kettlebell flows, but I know how much people hate advertising so I stay away from that.

As for my wrists, well, after doing this 16+ years (I'm 46) I'd say that my wrists are just fine, probably because of all this. I also run a group on Facebook with 12,000 kettlebell people in it, and their wrists are also fine, definitely not one of the main injuries or complaints when it comes to kettlebell training. Anything takes just one bad move and **bam**, the less you prepare for that, the more likely you will be **bamming**...",0

18543,"It really depends on what you are eating. If you are in a caloric deficit you should be losing weight. If you are weight lifting often then you should be gaining muscle as long as you providing correct nutrients to your muscles.

18545,"Great drill for improving reaching, overhead mobility, and stretching out the posterior chain. I use this before any upper body pressing exercises such as bench or overhead presses.

Equipment:

1) Open space
2) Box to elevate feet (optional)

Execution:

1) Walk out to a push up position.

2) Reach the knobby bone on your neck (C7 vertebrae) toward the ceiling (scapular protraction)

3) Tuck your back pockets (posterior pelvic tilt)

4) Walk feet toward the hands keeping knees straight, raising your bottom in the air, until significant stretch in calves or hamstrings.

5) Exhale all your air out of your mouth and feel your lower ribs fall down and back (feel abs)

6) Maintain ribs down and ab tension while silently breathing in through the nose.

7) Walk hands away from your feet and just past your head.

8) Exhale all your air out of your mouth and feel your lower ribs fall down and back (feel abs). 9) Maintain ribs down and ab tension while silently breathing in through the nose.

What to focus on:

1) Maintain your back pockets tucked (posterior pelvic tilt) during the entire movement.
2) Maintain lower ribs down.
3) Maintain shoulder blades protracted.

Why do this?

1) Improve your shoulder internal rotation (necessary for benching).
2) Learn to sequence breathing and ab activation with complex movement pattern.
3) Learn to maintain ribcage and pelvis position.
4) Stretch out the posterior chain.
5) Improve overhead mobility.

Start with 10-20yds of inchworms or perform 2x10 in place.

To lose weight you need to be in a caloric deficit. So either eat less or do more cardio. You don’t lift weights to lose weight you lift weights to build muscle. You do cardio to burn calories and for your heart health. It’s good for other things to but I’m not going to list everything.

The rest portion is okay. Better info would be: OP should aim for ~40 seconds time under tension, and 2 minutes rest between sets. When OP starts to fail drop the weight by 10% and repeat time under tension and rest periods. When OP cannot lift the weight they are done with said exercise. Before dropping weight by 10% OP could rest for 4 minutes instead but that’s a lot of time in the gym so first thing I mentioned is more efficient which I’d say overall is better.
Fast concentric (shortening) and slower eccentric (lengthening) of muscle(s) being used.
Rep range should aim for 10-15, is better 12-15.
Pick weights that OP can control, no ego lifting, use good form.",0

18637,"I had a similar issue too. I found that sometimes the pain would radiate up my heel and into my hamstrings. You can go on a non inflammatory diet, you can do more stretches before you work out (variations of animals walks are really good), or you can slowly and progressively work on strengthening your hamstrings with straight leg deadlifts at very light weight (and exceptional form). These all helped me a great deal but what help me most was changing the type of shoe I wore and using insoles. My shoes weren’t absorbing shock correctly while I was working out and that’s why I often got outrageously sore.",0

18639,"Have you ever heard of B-stance? It’s essentially a way to turn a lot of exercises unilateral but with the added bonus of being able to use the non-working leg for balance. It’s great for hip thrusts and dumbbell deadlifts especially, I’ve found! You can also use it for squat variations, as well.",0
18640,BTW your looking great.,0
18641,I had a lower double hernia 6 years ago. I went back to work too soon. I reinjured myself. I am hust now able ti workout regularly. I started very light and have been slowly progressing. I am now able tk workout 3 days a week with weights plus jogging with hardly any issues.,0
18642,"So a typical glute day for me would probably look something like:
Hip thrusts 4x8 (go pretty heavy here)
Good mornings 4x8-12
Goblet squats 4x8
Cable pull throughs 4x8-10
B-stance dumbbell RDL 4x8-12
If you haven’t already heard of B-stance, look it up! It was a game changer for me since I have a glute imbalance (right cheek is weaker than the left, haha) and it can be used for quite a few different exercises. Even if you don’t have an imbalance, it’s great for making sure you don’t develop one and also getting a bigger bang for your buck out of lighter weights, if that makes sense.",0

18666,"Go to your near max or max capacity until that gets easy. After it gets easy, work on different progressions, slow down rep speeds or add more resistance to it. I would recommend using resistance bands because it can really help with building size in pull ups and is portable.",0
18667,"To piggyback off what was just mentioned, it is true. 

Right now, your shoulders/front delts is stronger than your chest. When this happens, whenever performing a heavy exercise, your stronger muscles tend to compensate and do more of the heavy lifting than your weaker muscles. 

I personally have a problem with this. Best advice is to drop your weights to a point where the bench press gives your chest muscles more of a contraction/burn than you'll feel in your front deltoids (as mentioned above).

Also, either switch to dumbbells for a bit, if you already haven't or resistance bands. The latter is what I used to remedy my situation. Specifically the flat looped bands style. I honestly swear by them. 

Lastly, remember to work on isolating your chest for a bit and anytime you perform the exercise, imagine your pectoral muscles actually pulling your arms closer to the midline of your chest. Once, you have that in min and focus on feeling your chest contract and pull, you'll be on the way to performing bench presses that has the entirety of your chest/pectoral muscles working!!",0
18668,Good idea! Might also switch 2 days in the week out and do them on the weekend when I don’t have to be up at 5. Can keep my intensity up for the weekends sessions instead.,0
18669,"Do not go too low when you drop weights. I currently use a rep style I learned from James Grage. It's consist of 4-sets with the rep ranges  being as follows; 

20 reps(1st set) - 10 reps(2nd set) - 10 reps(3rd set) - 15 reps(4th set)

This helped me not only lose weight, but gain quite a bit of muscle fast! This is coming from a former football lineman too, where size means a lot.

18690,"I mean its mediocre and imbalanced. You'll get really good at doing those things at the specific ranges. Honestly you're probably not burning that many calories either as you get more efficient at it. 

Also from an injury point of view, normally there would be concern over getting hurt. In this case you're not doing anything joint or wear and tear heavy. So its doubtful.

Why not just do a full body routine for 3 days and then 2 to 3 days of different kinds of cardio. Build a balanced set of muscle so that your whole body is healthy?",0
18691,"this might be random advice but try and do the leg extensions before the leg curls or  just working ur quads before ur glutes. Most people are glute dominant if u work the quad muscle first it might help get even tension to ur quads and have them balance out. alternatively get a foam roller and make it your  best friend. It might be a lot of things , u could be dehydrated , too sore , have deep muscle scar tissue from overtraining a few times in soccer or gliding the wrong way etc",0
18692,"look into face massages. They help tighten the muscle. You can do it to yourself at home.

18697,kim is not fit at all. She barely has any muscle. Its mostly fat and prob surgeries. She has good genetics though. Squats will give u both butt muscle and leg muscle. To get the butt benefit of squats u need to go to adequate depth do parallel  to the ground with ur hamstrings.  If u just want a butt the best exercise for that imo is hip thrusts. U can do it on the leg extension machine. leg curls and leg extensions will build the rest of ur legs. Just having a butt looks weird if u dont have the legs to go with it.,0
18698,"get a gym membership , find a workout routine of lifting weights specifically for beginners. I advise full body 4 times a week. Start slow , learn the movements , warmup a bit , stretch a bit. don't increase the weight until u get the technique right. as for diet , honestly. Idk how much u weight but if ur like the majority of people 20% or more body fat then 1.5g per kilo of LEAN body mass is more than enough. More might be better but its very small difference. So my example , 90 kg 22% bodyfat. That leaves me with 71kg of lean mass , 71x1.5 =110 grams of protein or so a day. Don't be too strict on calorie counting but have a rough estimation. good Carbs are not bad.  good cholesterol is not bad. as long as ur eating healthy dotn matter too much what fat and carb % of ur diet they take. Just get ur protein in and fill the rest with healthy foods and u'll be fine. Put 250 calories or so a day for a treat. Whatever u wanna eat , 250 calories of it. Icecream , chocolate , cake, pizza.... 

&amp;#x200B;

there you go. :)

goodluck bud. It's not hard , its fun. Have fun and enjoy it. U don't have to eat chicken and brocoli every day , change things up. Try and get ur proteins in though thats a huge part of building muscle.",0

18703,"well its not bad at all. From an injury point of view. You just need to realize that the muscles you train are the ones that will grow and if you are target training certain parts of your body then you should target the right ones , right now  ur doing core and glutes and inner thighs i think. Imo girls should work all their legs but maybe ur quads and hamstrings are already developped idk. Thats just my opinion. So consider that for what its worth. As for your question , to put it simply , as long as you're resting adequately for the amount of intensity ur putting in it then its safe to train everyday.  hamstrings and quands are what make up the majority of the leg muscle though. You can do leg curls and leg extension machines and those should do the trick.

18798,"OK, what do recommend I should wear? A pair of sneakers? Because they only have a thin layer to protect my toes. The only thing that would protect my toes are steel capped shoes. However, after decades of training and training thousands of people, I can tell you that when you're not wearing protection you will develop reflexes, you will develop instincts that are primal, rather than relying on what one might think is protection.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your concern, and I'm not trying to be a smart ass, just trying to show you the better way. Training without shoes is going to be the thing in 10 years from now.

I use a belt and breath in.. then in a little more to get as compressed as I can. Key is proper form. Get the bar in the correct spot. YouTube is good reference. .. I can't stress form enough. 

The delts are  relatively small muscles and fatigue pretty quick.. but they recover quickly as well. I added additional OHP days. Once a week wasn't seeing much gains. I now go twice in 6 days.

18870,"The body typically responds to resistance training first by making neurological adaptations as compared to hypertrophy for about the first 4 weeks of training.  So you likely won’t see any physical changes in 3 weeks, although it’s not impossible.

I say that because it's much harder to ramp up muscle buidling after a serious cut, and you might lose a bit of lean mass in the process just to get rid of some belly fat. But if you think long term, and I'd say make small changes over the next few months for recomp (eat at or just barely above maintenance) and hit a really high protein relative to your macros, it will help you continue to progress through your PHUL routine and slowly burn off body fat.

18922,"In general, someone who consistently works out but has appropriate rest will see increases in size at about 8-10 weeks. You do get strength increases before then due to strengthening of your nervous system. 

Keep moving!",0
18923,"The best advice I have for you is to really focus on form and perfecting this. Don’t sweat the volume of exercise. This list is very long.

At your age, I let my ego get the best of my exercises and I stressed quantity over quality. My workouts were long and all over the place. This had me develop imbalances. I had large chest, shoulder, and quads. But my back and true core muscles were weak and quick to tire. No great for injury prevention and performance.

Focus on the basic lifts. Toss in body weight stuff and a COUPLE auxiliary lifts. Build a strong foundation to build you movement competence on. It wasn’t until college that I had to go back and work thru my imbalances a poor form to get where I should have been starting off.

Get someone to watch your form, perfect that before you worry about how many plates you can stack. Do 1 or 2 more sets of your core lift rather than add 5 extra auxiliary lifts. 

When you forge a stronger foundation ( it will take time, be patient), I promise you that if you are smart, you ability to increase strength, speed, or endurance will happen very quickly (relatively). 

Keep moving",0
18924,"Unless you have a illness, this will not happen. General rule of thumb, it takes muscle 3 days to detrain. If immobilized completely, there will be a decent bit of atrophy in 1-2 weeks. 

You are fine if you are generally healthy and exercise somewhat frequently.",0
18925,"If you aren’t concerned about the burden of counting calories, don’t.

Get a well balanced diet. Because it is even more important for your health due to your lifestyle. Eat until you are no longer hungry. That’s good enough if you don’t plan on training to be an elite athlete or bodybuilder.

Regardless, assuming you are a beginner, you will see some changes over time with consistency. First you will increase strength but not necessarily size. This is your nerves getting better at “turning on your muscles”. After 8 weeks or so you will see a change in size.

If you are worried about becoming “too bulky” , don’t. That type of transformation is intentional. If it were accidental, I’d accidentally win a couple gold medals in the next Olympics.

Good luck!
Keep moving",0
18927,"Could depend on your age or your training methods.

If you are young, your size will come when you naturally get more testosterone. This will be responsible for you ability to achieve hypertrophy (increase in size). 

If you haven’t already, try and work at reps of 6-12 within 67-85% of your new max. This is textbook numbers to achieve size. But know you can stray into lower reps and more weight and still work towards size while continuing to stress adaptations towards more strength.

The reason for increased strength but no increase in size is because of your neurological changes. Your body can now recruit more muscle fibers and larger motor units to increase your strength. Hypertrophy tends to take 8+ weeks for changes to be seen. Any increases in performance before that is neurologic.

Keep moving!",0
18928,"Best advice I can give:

Find a certified trainer or strength and conditioning coach, pick up a book (NSCA Strength and Conditioning is dense but good) and educate yourself on the basic principles, work on a well balanced diet (no fads or restrictive diets). There are ZERO quick ways to fitness.

It is a behavior, a habit, it is consistency. The more you understand or are appropriately guided will lead you to your desired results.

PS- You cannot target certain areas of body fat. You body just uses fat where it can grab it regardless of what exercise you do. It tends to use visceral fats (around your organs) first and then subcutaneous (under the skin) last. A poor diet can make it difficult for your body to burn fat over other energy sources.

Once you have those two down calculate your bmr (how many calories you need daily ) then setup an eating plan to eat at a deficit of that daily ( 300 to 500 below maintenance levels) and then add in exercising at least 4x weekly for 20 mins ( I like using weights, kettlebells, and slam balls).

18944,"Hey there! Just my 2 cents as a corrective exercise trainer--

If you're seeing the chiropractor for your low back pain &amp; it's not improving, you need to re-evaluate things. If the chiro isn't giving you exercises to do at home for this, and the only things you do with the chiro are adjustments, you def need to re-evaluate the situation. You only need to ask yourself, is this a sustainable way for you to treat the low back pain long-term?

A common cause of low back pain these days is not having enough underlying muscular support in the area for your low back. Think of how our bodies are structured-- a bunch of bones &amp; muscles up top, then a small section where it's just one bone, and then below that are a bunch more bones &amp; muscles. That section where it's just one bone, is the low back area.. it has way less bone support, it has the weight of your entire body on it, AND it has the job of keeping your upper body stacked on top of your lower body so that when you take a step forward, your upper body comes with your legs!

I'd highly recommend you look into some deep core stabilization exercises. It isn't so much how strong you are (or how many reps, or how long you can do/hold the exercise), it's more about if you're doing the exercise CORRECTLY. That's how you ensure that the right muscles are being worked. Here's a section of an article: 

* Connect with your deep core, the transversus abdominus (example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwx6uCwhUQ)). You can use this as a warm-up for the next exercise, or just do this for now if the next one isn’t working.
* Work the deep core! [Dead bug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=I5xbsA71v1A) is a great one to start with. **Do not** let your hips move or get pulled by your legs, so only go as far as you can while maintaining a stable pelvis. If you need to make it easier, leave your arms resting by your sides and/or keep your knees bent as you lower. If you want to challenge yourself, keep your legs straight throughout the whole movement!

In the meantime, focusing on improving your nutrition will go a very long way in helping you get fit!

Good luck!",0
18945,I actually just went shopping for some general house stuff and I ended up buying a pair of dumbbells as well! I can look at doing that for the desk too but I'm not too confident in it's stability,0
18946,"That's great progress so far!

How big of a caloric deficit are you on? Just a thought-- if it's too extreme, it will trigger a stress response. Exercise is another stressor and if it's too intense, it will also trigger a stress response. One of the big things that can happen in a stress response is the production of cortisol, which makes it harder for you to lose weight.

Otherwise, are you eating appropriate macro's? Enough protein, some carbs, some fat? And yeah, it might also be that your TDEE dropped (are you doing strengthening exercises?)

Also, how are you quantifying your progress? Are you noticing any physical changes? It's normal to hit a plateau once in a while. You may want to consider having a day every so often where you let yourself eat over your calories (with good quality food) Going by progress pics can give you a more accurate measure of your progress; weight can change day by day by a variety of things.

18953,"You're about to enter into a magical period of time called ""beginner gains""! The jump from doing nothing to something, is HUGE (which is also why it's a good idea to not overwork yourself in the beginning), and your body is going to be wiring in all these new connections plus start the process of building extra muscle mass, both of which will lead to you getting stronger. Strength isn't just about muscle mass, it's about your brain &amp; nervous system knowing how to recruit it. So to answer your question-- not just possible, but probable!

Sticking with just the gym &amp; trying to eat healthier in a ""general"" way is a totally valid way to start. Eventually, you may want to start incorporating macro &amp; calorie management, but none of that has to be an overnight overhaul.

Eventually, like years into it, you'd have to start managing your calories, macros, and cycles if you want to specifically pack on muscle mass. You don't have to worry about that at this point.

Here’s the excerpt from my [IG post](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7HAMhShU0Z/?igshid=2u70d69fze36)  post. 

Great move to hydrate and strengthen the quad muscles. We especially use this exercise for our patients with anterior knee pain toward the middle and late stages of their physical therapy. Plus, it uses little to no equipment.

Equipment:

1) Towel or airex pad for knee padding.

What to focus on:

1) Stack ribcage and pelvis (tuck tour bottom a little).
2) Reach the arms forward (scapula protraction).
3) Slowly lower your body down over the course of 4-6 seconds.

Why do this?

1) Strengthen the quads while lengthening the muscle.
2) Hydrate the quad muscles.
3) Learn to maintain ribcage and pelvis position.
4) Challenging exercise that can be done anywhere with little to no equipment.

Start with 2 or 3 sets of 8-10 reps.",0

Not heard of stiff legged deadlift, will look it up, I'm not sure I have the strength yet for deadlift though :P

19049,"You might see something in 3 weeks as you're already very thin but honestly I'd suggest forgetting such a short timeline, it's a marathon not a sprint and it typically takes at least a few months to even see minimal results. Going every day and training multiple times a day isn't going to work for strength training either, you need to take at least a day between sessions if training the same body parts to allow your body to recover as recovery is when muscle is built. In fact, I'd bet if you do squats and stiff legged deadlift (my 2 fav glute exercises) you're going to be pretty sore the next day to the point of potentially having some difficulty walking if you hit it hard as a beginner.",0

19122,"The two are not related. Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) is due to micro tears in the muscles while training, this is seen more when walking down incline and also slowing the amount of time to lower the bar to your chest during bench press. That muscle soreness just means you had a good workout.  You can decrease DOMS by doing short cardio before and after your workout.",0
19123,"The best way to burn fat is to train early in the morning on an empty stomach. Your body will be using body fat as it's primary fuel source since you've been fasting overnight. 

Second alternative is high intensity training (HIT) whereby you run for 1 minutes at your full speed usually at an incline, then walk for 3 minutes and repeat. Training like this will increase your post-exercise oxygen consumption (epoc) so you will burn more calories after training, commonly called afterburn.",0
19124,"Hi motivated by how many calories I burn, so I've been using Polar products for years, I'm Dad👨",0
19125,"First of all thank you for sharing!   
Keep it simple at the beginning.   
1. **Track Your Calories** \- I'm motivated by how many calories I burn, so I've been using Polar products for years. The Polar OH1 syncs to your smart phone and accurately keeps track of the calories that you burn in the gym. This is great because if you have a *clear calorie goal* then you know when you've had a good workout. You want to burn 700-1000 calories an hour for a good workout. 

2. **Begin with Cardio** \- walk on the treadmill 15 minutes before your workout and try to get slowly increase the incline over the days. If your out of breath that's good! It means your increasing your endurance. 

3. Research these basic exercises for body parts. Fitbod has a pretty good app  


* **Chest** \- bench press, incline bench press, and decline bench press, pushups 
* **Back** \- dumbbell rows, machine lat pull downs, v bar pulldown
* Arms - dumbbell curls, tricep extension, dumbbell kickbacks

It may take a few weeks to get the coordination of the movements correct, but overtime your muscles will learn how to balance the weight. 

The most important thing however, is to eat small meals every 4 hours. Good amount of protein, some say 1gm per kg (1kg = 2.2lbs) per day. You need protein and carbs to build muscle. 

Good luck. Find a good music playlist! And remember the hardest part of working out is getting to the gym!",0
19126,That works your inner thighs!,0
19127,That’s just good high intensity training. Your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age. Keep up the great work. Benefit of high intensity training is the afterburn effect whereby you burn more calories post work out!,0

I had the same question you asked. How long to see results?? Everyone seemed to see results before I did. Someone on reddit answered that question and it proved to be true.

Most people are exercising to lose weight and gain muscle. The thing is that you can see results faster when you have fat to burn. The results of losing fat are visible much faster than definition that comes with adding muscle. Losing 5 pounds of weight can make a big visible different without adding much muscle. Adding muscle, on the other hand, takes 3-4 months of regular exercise. I’ve read as long as 8 months.

So I suspect you are seeing the same thing I saw (or didn’t see) you aren’t seeing results as quickly because you aren’t overweight. 

That said, make sure you are getting enough protein to support the new muscles that are forming.",0

19182,"225 and you want to cut down?! Only way I'd want this is if I was doing a race and wanted to take stress off my joints in my legs.

Either way, you will likely need to track caloric deficit way more like the other guy said. Your body is used to optimizing muscle usage, and so unless you start eating like garbage too to where the body uses calories differently, a good deficit will only do it.

Can't advise on what you deficit should be since I do not know what your resting metabolic rate for calories burned is and calories burned during workouts.",0
19183,"They are getting used to the same motions over and over. If you're going for more muscle growth or different definition goals, etc. you'll want to consistently have exercises for muscle groups you rotate in and out every few weeks.

One of the best tips I ever got to avoid plateauing was to ""always keep your muscles guessing what they are going to see next"". The body responds more dramatically to new and varied stimulus and growth - it prepares for more types of activity by that different engagement.

Soreness could also be less due to better nutrition and sleep. But if you're going hard enough on your workouts and not feeling much soreness - you CAN still be getting better, but the muscles are more used to that stimulus and thus you may not experience as much growth.",0

I have sagging belly skin that I know I’ll probably never lose even if I get a super flat stomach. I had my daughter when I was 25 (I’m 33 now) and had pre-eclampsia. My average weight at that time (at 5’4”) was around 140, but less than a day after giving birth to her at just 33wks, I was 205, mostly due to the immense water retention from the pre-eclampsia. I lost 40lbs of water weight very quickly, and gained a tummy flap that will never go away.

One day in a dressing room my daughter noticed it. I told her, “Oh, that? That’s my warrior pouch. That’s where I carried you! I was super sick right before you were born and got so big that it stretched my tummy and gave me this little pouch. Some people might think it’s ugly but I think it’s AWESOME! It always reminds me of that hard work and being strong and carrying you!”

Okay, so in my heart at that moment? I didn’t mean it 100%. But I knew I couldn’t get rid of it, and I knew I would never ever let my daughter see me say anything but loving things about myself. The more I said it, starting on that day, the more I believed it.

Sure, it’s not ever going to be easy to just be like “I love every part of my body and LOVE my tummy pouch!” But that’s okay! We don’t HAVE to love it. But we can choose to look at it more neutral, to say, hey, this is a mark of my life. This is part of my history. You can dress around it and find clothes that make you feel fantastic.

AND you can work to get rid of it, going all the way to considering or getting surgery, and you are STILL fantastic! You don’t have to love it or like it or accept it ever.

I love to help people and Funny story, I did a random yoga class (I’m 35/male) and a random younger kid introduced himself to me and we sorta talked a little and that was it...now I’ve seen him multiple times in the gym and I just give him a first bump and move on, but the last time I saw him he came up to me and said hi and asked how I was doing. I noticed something was off and immediately thouht he had severe anxiety. Anyway he started talking about why he Joined the gym due to trying to meet people, and now hard it was for him. I think my kind and understanding nature made him feel comfortable opening up and just want you to know there’s regular kind hearted people out there like me that aren’t judging you .anxiety can be crippling but it doesn’t always have to be that way. I’m living proof. God speed my friend!",0
19226,"So my experience with alcohol and exercise is sorta random. I’m a consistent lifter and runner , and only have 2-3 beers once a week. Occasionally, on the weekend I’d hang with my buddy and we’d throw a few shots down and go run sprints with a football or lift some weights ...I’ve got a lot of experience and am conditioned well, so I don’t do anything I’m not capable of. But it’s totally not worth it in my opinion, as alcohol dehydrates you and fatigues you weaker , not to mention makes you weaker , so you’re sub optimal at best. I don’t recommend it but can’t say I haven’t done it a handful of times",0

19233,"Absolutely agree!  

I used to have a really demanding job, which prevented me from getting home early.  On top of that, I had/have a SO, so when I was getting off work at 6 or 7 pm, I wanted to spend those few hours before bed with her.  Thus, my workouts were getting skipped.  I decided to start working out in the mornings before work, which meant I would need to be at the gym by 5 am in order to get a full workout in, get ready for work, and make it on time.  This meant, I had to get up around 4:30 am to be at the gym by 5 am.  I thought I was going to hate this schedule, but like you said, the workout provided me with a surge of energy for the day.  Not to mention, I started enjoying running in silence while on the treadmill so I could focus on my day and get my objectives in line.  This actually led me to realizing I prefer morning workouts over evening workouts.  Now, I have a job that isn't so demanding, and allows for me to be at the gym by 8 am.",0
19234,"I workout in the mornings as soon as possible after waking up.  I prefer working out before I eat anything.  I find myself being lethargic at the gym if I go in after eating, and my workouts aren't near as intense.  Not that I do ""intense"" workouts, but, well, you know.  If I workout in the evenings, I try to allow 6 hours for my food from lunch to digest to avoid being lethargic or gassy.",0

19250,"Ideally I do weights in the morning to wake up.  Then I do cardio in the evening so I can just go home when I'm all gross and sweaty.  I usually don't get too sweaty when I lift, which probably says something.",0

19261,"Depends on your overall hydration levels before the workout, length of workout, and intensity of workout. Unless you're doing some insanely intense workouts in a short period of time or working out for way more than an hour just drink a bit extra and salt your food if you're really worried about it.",0
19262,How important is it to drink it during workouts though?,0
19263,"Yes. As well as muscle fatigue. If you are severely dehydrated, then yes you might get constipated. No guarantee. It is after all one of many symptoms that may or may not occur for many different reasons.

Look just make sure you get enough potassium and sodium. Drink water whenever you're thirsty and with meals. This isn't rocket science.",0
19264,Because cardio raises  your heart and breathing rate that could dehydrate you? But dehydration is one of the main cause of constipation. So could hiit training that causes dehydration also cause constipation?,0
19265,"Drink water when thirsty and get enough potassium and sodium. You'll be fine. Just breathing and being alive dehydrates you. So yeah a workout, especially cardio based will dehydrate you. Constipated is probably from your diet. Everyone is different, I get the opposite reaction from workouts.",0

19267,"The best exercise is probably swimming (good for lung capacity and the typically warm, moist air is less likely to trigger an asthmatic event). Other good activities are biking, yoga and walking. It’s best to avoid cold air if you’re out and about.

19268,"I recommend you do slow, steady and smooth pull ups. Do not jerk or kick your legs in an attempt to squeeze one out, that will definitely result in injury. Slow and steady pull yourself up and slow and steady go back down, use a stool for your legs to help you in the first month. Make sure you do pull ups and not chin-ups, chin ups focus more on arms.",0
19269,"thanks so much for the response! I was thinking about getting a pull up bar, the only issue is that i have a bad shoulder. I dislocated it years back and now it pops out a few times a year if i move my arm the wrong way or something. It’s never happened while i was working out, but i’m careful when doing things like bench press or anything that puts tension on the shoulder. I’m not sure if doing pull ups would put any unwanted tension on my shoulder and force it to pop out but i suppose it is definitely worth a try",0
19270,"
I’ve had the same issue in the past and  used countless machines and other crazy nonsense to get my back looking good. It wasn’t until I was in New Jersey for a month and saw a female Marine with an amazing back, I’m not talking about body builder back but a nice toned back with strong muscles. I nervously asked her what she did to get a back like that and she told me to just do pull ups. I suck at pull ups but I gave it a shot, I forced myself to do 100 dead hang pull ups a day. No matter how long it took or how many times I dismounted the bar I shook it off and remounted the bar until I did 100. 

If you can’t do one I recommend you grab a chair  or stool and use one leg for assist until you no longer need it.

After 6 months I’m finally at my goal. Hope it helps I know it helped me.",0

19291,Thanks so much for your thoughtful response. I will definitely try this out!,0
19292,"It’s not so much about the exercise but about how you work out. From my experience lifting heavy with low reps does not build size all the much while lifting lighter and doing more reps increases size and strength but you will not build the same strength you would if you lifted heavy with low reps. I would focus on doing drop sets on exercises that work your glutes. Such as squats, lunges, hip thrusts etc. for example start with a weight that you can squat 12 times. Then drop the weight 20 percent (15 second rest) and do it again. Do this 3-5 sets and then go to your next exercise. 

This will be hard to do for a few weeks but after that you will be able to do tons of reps once your body adapts to this type of working out. I would also suggest hitting your lower very frequently. Probably every other day. You could do every day but that could be a bit excessive and you need rest. 

Keep in mind that exercising this way is not a great way to build strength. You will build some and you will be able to do reps like crazy but you won’t be able to squat 500 pounds or anything. Also you will lose size and strength pretty quick if you stop working out. 

This is not a recommended course of action if you want to build strength but you will build size quick. I would suggest doing this for 3-6 months and then just hitting legs once or twice a week just to maintain size. Unless you like exercising or are a bit of a gym rat.",0

19383,"At what point did the original post say it was curls and where did it say ""only"" 50 reps? ""Batches"" of 50 reps, still doing 500 total. If its bicep curls then yeah not a whole lot of harm will come from doing it but a beginner doing 500 reps anything can happen (I.E. tendonitis which I know I got when I first started and I wasn't doing nearly 500 reps, albeit in sets of 50).

Besides, that style of workout is very un optimal for a beginner. Not everything I said was to prevent injury there's just a much more efficient path.

19390,"I found that some live instruction really went a long way in helping me with the personal knowledge and skills I needed for a home program. Back when I had the $ the investment in a personal trainer was great, the personal feedback helped me learn about my individual form. Gym membership with group classes included (like LA Fitness) can really provide a big bang for the buck, try different classes to learn different skills. 

But probably the best education value for me was a boot camp class at my local community college. $88 for the semester, and I learned sooo much about functional fitness and how to exercise using little to no equipment. The class was small enough that the instructor provided personal feedback, best value ever. I've since purchased some prize pieces of equipment (a few dumbells, a weighted wall ball, kettlebell, resistance bands), combined with calisthenics I can do a lot in my small house. I do the movements I've learned in classes, and read online and in books from the library to expand on what I know. I'm unemployed so no more classes or trainers for me :(

I also highly recommend [https://www.fitwithvlad.com/](https://www.fitwithvlad.com/) (site I learned about from Reddit), he has some great equipment-free workouts that are really amazing (I'm a woman, and can't do everything to the level he suggests, but it is a good starting point).

If you're trying to get stronger arms, I recommend doing other exercises as well. Triceps, forearms, chest, back, and shoulders all play a role in having strong arms.

You will strengthen your core SO well into your adulthood.  
You will look SO GOOD in absolutely ANYTHING you wear, because you will NOT have that sad little ""pooch bulge"" below your belly button. All that is, is lazy abdominals. NOT attractive.

You will have better posture, especially when sitting, because your abdominals will be stronger and used to being in a more activated state.

A physician once said ""If you can do 2000 sit ups a day, you will never need an abdomiplasty (a tummy-tuck).""  
We are talking SIT UPS, not crunches, which too many people do incorrectly and which can actually damage you.  
An additional exercise to consider is what I call ""suck ups."" You lie flat, and simply contract your abdominals by sucking your stomach flat to the floor, and then relax and repeat. These are fun to do to music in bed, (about 100 per song on average), and are just as effective for your abs as the whole fling your body up and down thing...

So yes, ANY active effort on your part EVERY DAY will have LOTS of benefits for you.   
Sit ups (or suck ups) have extra benefits for your abdominal core, which result in looking good, feeling stronger, and, should the day ever arise, making pregnancy and childbirth easier.

"" A woman’s unique experience of symptoms starts with the tongue and goes  through the entire digestive tract. More women can be classified as  “supertasters” – they are able to taste both bitter and sweet foods more  strongly than men. They don't need as much of the food to determine if  the food is bitter or sweet. This increased sensitivity of the gut to  different types of stimulation is seen throughout a woman's GI tract.  Normal women have been shown to be more sensitive to pressure from an  inflated balloon placed in the esophagus (swallowing tube between the  mouth and the stomach), small intestine, colon or large intestine, and  rectum than men. Through each area of the digestive tract, we will talk  about symptoms unique to women, their causes, risk factors, testing and  treatment.

 Women also seem to have slower emptying of food from the stomach than men.  Women also have slower emptying from the large intestine when compared with men.   The GI tract muscles in women may function differently compared with men. Women have slower gallbladder emptying than men normally and are twice as likely to develop gallstones as men.   Colon cancer is the number 3 cancer for women in the United States.    IBD is more frequent in women with a ratio of about 2:1.  """,0

Squat 3 x 10-15
Row 3 x 10-15
Deadlift 3 x 10-15

Again, see how your body responds and adjust from there. Too easy? Add a 4th set. Too hard? Only do 2 sets or only do 8-10 reps. 

First week is always a feeling out process to kind of see where you're at. It definitely helps to track your exercises as well, at least at the start so you can visualize your progress. Every week try and do a little more whether it's more sets, more reps, more weight, etc. 

Lastly..and I know I'm throwing a lot at ya.. but please make sure you research form for all these exercises. Don't get into the habit of bad form early on. Nothing good comes from it. If something doesn't feel right, especially as you fatigue, just cut the set short.",0

My suggestion: Don't want this to come off in a mean way or anything but my guess is you are a very beginner? If this is the case, work on building a foundation first.

Example of this is the bench press. You work your chest, shoulders, and triceps all at the same time.

19591,"My suggestion - tuck your feet and use them to help you get up if you have to. Try not to swing your arms though!..unless you have to.

You are much stronger eccentrically (going down) than you are concentrically (going up).

Also sit ups will not burn fat on your stomach. They will build muscle on your stomach. It's not possible (to my knowledge at least) to target fat loss. If burning fat is the goal, nutrition should be your number 1 focus.

As for the actual workout, I used the app WorkIt to build a routine i found researching online and focused on dumbbells, as to me they were a lot less intimidating than barbells.  Tracking my workout allowed me to focus on increasing weights bit by bit to ensure I was building strength and in the meantime, I spent time doing more research and watching a lot of videos on youtube to learn about form and tips for the major compound exercises I wanted to do (bench press, squats, and deadlifts).

19626,"Hello and congratulations on your resolution!
First, it seems you don't really want to do this. It sounds like you think you should, because it's new year and you should have some resolutions and it's expected by the society.

Please, your step number one should be psychological - change your mindset. And trust me i used to hate exercise for 99% of my life! I'm still overweight. But i managed to change my mindset in the last year.

If you don't like jogging, don't! I even think you'd probably hate it now since you're not used to exercise at all. Start by 20min walk a day. Just go outdoors and breathe fresh air, notice what you see - the sun, clouds, trees, birds... Don't expect anything, just enjoy your new habit.

Another option is doing 15-20min video of yoga or low impact exercise.
It's a great idea to get a set of adjustable dumbbells and do simple strength training at home. Strength training can be more important than cardio and its more fun! It's also absolutely important for women, too! 

Maybe try dancing, cycling, hiking, swimming.

Whatever you choose, let it be something you don't hate. Just build a habit of doing something at least 20-30 min 3x a week. Don't even expect weight loss yet. Your only focus now is building a habit and learning not to hate it! After some time, you'll naturally find out what you enjoy and you'll want to improve.

It's a great idea to watch Motivational videos about your favorite sports in yt and joining reddit and fb groups.

Also consider your nutrition. Don't fall into diet trap where you'll only eat green salads and starve yourself and then eat entire fridge at night. Do proper research about healthy diet containing plenty of protein and enough healthy fat and healthy carbs.

I know you won't believe me now, but healthy lifestyle isn't torture. You don't have to starve, you can enjoy delicious food and you can feel good after exercise. It took me 24 years of stupid diets and torturing myself needlessly to understand this.

The point is to start slowly and gradually and don't expect any miracles. This is what you'll be doing for the rest of your life, there's no rush.",0

In this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8651838), only 12% of people on diets could maintain their weight loss after 3 years. Let that sink in. 12%....

Likewise, there's no difference between low carb and low fat diets as this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29466592) shows. If you burn more than you eat, you will lose weight no matter the macronutrient distribution. For example this guy [lost weight eating only junk food ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nydailynews.com/life-style/lose-weight-eating-junk-food-nutrition-professor-drops-27-pounds-twinkie-diet-months-article-1.453215%3foutputType=amp). 

So whats the solution? Eat less than you burn, and choose nutritious foods. Macronutrient restriction is counterproductive to most because it cuts out lots of good nutritious options. Low fat people can't eat guacamole and peanut butter. Low carb people can't eat fruits. But one who doesnt diet can eat both which sets them up for better long term success.",0

Listen to it every time you do a particular work out ( Cardio vs weights). Continue this for a couple weeks/months. Then listen to the playlist in your car or at home when you are trying to motivate yourself to get to the gym. 

This trick also works to keep me up for late drives. I have a “running mix” that I’ve listened to for ~10 years that has only been slightly updated over the years. My brain wakes up and my muscles want to move and stretch out whenever I listen to mix.",0

19658,"I found keto extremely easy to stick with. At this point, it’s more of a lifestyle than a diet. It’s second nature now, even when I’m on vacation. I’m no longer attracted to sugary and carbohydrate laden foods. It just doesn’t give me that mouth watering appeal anymore. I feel happier eating clean foods (my mouth waters for avocados lol).

I went from 250 to 190 in a matter of months and I found that I was always satisfied with less food as I lost weight. My diet now mainly consists of dairy, nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits (very rarely except avocados), chicken, fish, and meat (also rarely).

Cheating is inevitable with any lifestyle, but the important thing is that you get back on track. Don’t let one day of cheating turn into weeks, and so on.

The hardest part was learning the ins and outs of keto, and getting my journey started. Once I got going, it got much easier. I was able to experiment more with what I ate (introducing new foods, new recipes, etc.).

Counting calories is definitely a good start though. I actually started my weight loss journey by fasting for 3 days. I began by eyeballing or estimating the amount of calories I was eating, but I found that I was way off after I purchased a food scale and actually weighed all my foods.",0

19672,"TL:DW

Crashing mid workout is quite common.

1. Dont be scared to take a longer break. I would rather have you take a 20 minute break and then complete the workout with intensity rather than leaving early or being so tired at the end of the workout that your performance is worse.
2. Take that break but STAY FOCUSED. Don't be one of the people mindlessly browsing Instagram - stay mindful of the session. What exercise is next? How long are you going to be hitting that? How many reps are you planning to get? These thoughts should stay in your mind.
3. Switch up the music. Changing genres seems to 'refresh' my energy and style of workout
4. Get some sugars in mid session!! This is a niche bodybuilder tactic - take in a couple of sweets with you or a sugared drink. Carbs from sugar hit you much faster than 'normal' carbs and will boost your performance whilst still in the same session.
5. I've found a massive energy and mood boost from assessing my body. When my energy has crashed mid workout I'll often go to the changing rooms and get shirtless. Seeing my weakpoints and strengths in front of me as well as feeling proud of my results helps boost my energy.",0

You don’t have to jog. This is coming from a runner, but I run because I enjoy it. Not everyone does. Give it a try and know that for anyone just starting out, it can be rough in the beginning and you should stick it out for a bit. I highly recommend c25k as others suggested. But if you’re several weeks in and still hating it, try something different. You can bike, swim, do yoga, Pilates, Zumba, kickboxing, jazzercise, dance classes, the possibilities are endless and there is so much free stuff on YouTube. Investing in a couple simple pieces of home equipment such as a pair of dumbbells or resistance bands is a great idea (but not required). Contrary to popular belief, you don’t HAVE to do cardio, plenty of people do exclusively or mostly weight lifting and see great results. 

The most important thing is just to do something. Even if it’s 5 minutes. You’ll have days where “I just don’t feel like it.” Tell yourself you’re just going to start walking and you can turn around and go back to your house after 5 minutes if you want to. Odds are you’ll keep going once you’re out there. The hardest part is starting.",0

2. Doing [""hard sets"" of strength work](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/).

Eat meals with protein, and whether it's bench presses or pushups, if you do many ""hard sets"" you will build muscle.  So don't try and go non-stop.  Do a ""hard set"" (for you), another, and so on.  Over time increase the number of sets, and increase the number of reps to make sure it stays ""hard.""  This of course exposes the problem with body-weight exercises--you can't just add more weight to the bar to make it harder.",0

19713,"If you want to put on muscle you should really try to diversify your workouts, do more than just pushups. I would recommend you try a push, pull, and legs routine. *Assuming you don’t have access to a gym* For your “push day” you can do you push ups and maybe some dips off a step/chair. For “pull day” you should try to do pull ups, maybe loop a band around your feet and the bar to assist with the reps. For you “leg day” start with body weight squats and multi directional lunges in equal proportions.

As for the number of sets/reps, I’d say do sets of 4 or 5 at about 70% intensity. For example; if I can do 10 push-ups exerting max effort, I will do 5 sets of 7 push ups during my workout (because 70% of 10 reps is 7).

As you get more confident with this routine you need to implement some core exercises and cardiovascular exercise. Maybe a fast walk on the treadmill or another physical activity of some sort. For core I would try different types of planks and birddogs (look it up).

I see a therapist too, and I’ve gotten back into journaling. So the three forms of therapy for me have literally been what has saved me from so many things. I still have breakdowns after rough sessions with my therapist. But there’s just something about putting on the workout clothes and drinking the preworkout and then going into that gym and really getting in tune with the weights and the bars and the machines. All I need is my music of choice and my water bottle and I am in a meditative state that really works for me. It lets me journal afterwards with a clearer mind.",0
19726,"If changing your eating habits in a positive way works for you, that's great. Do the no brainier stuff like not drinking calories, make plans so you don't eat impulsively when you're hungry and make less great choices. But don't make yourself hate food and eating. Find a few things you'd like to eat *more* of, rather than less and trust that you'll be replacing less healthy choices. Maybe find some ways you *really* like to eat winter vegetables or a delicious recipe for lentil soup. If you like what you're eating, you will comply with it more. 

In my experience, doing something is easier than not doing something. People on here talk all about how nutrition is more important than exercise, but ignore the behavioral differences in compliance. 15lbs in 6 months is not a super aggressive goal. That's less than a pound a week.  If you actively choose to move your body more, especially if it's also fun and includes spending time with people you love, you'll turn it into a life long thing. The health benefits of exercise are much better supported than the benefits of weight loss.

I would also think about what in particular your doctor is concerned with via your weight. Was this in relation to an issue? Your cholesterol levels? Blood pressure? Chronic pain? Have you had recent sudden weight gain? Or was this a tossed off, knee jerk reaction to your BMI?",0
19727,"First and foremost is your nutrition. As a picky eater, it's especially important that you're mindful of getting the necessary daily requirements for your macro and micro nutrients. I would look into some of the community posts about what to eat to gain healthy weight and match that against a list of things you can't stomach. It's also important to remember the difference between what you CAN'T eat and what you just don't like; I'd love to eat Big Mac's everyday but I know I have to eat some things I'm not thrilled about to sustain myself. 

Once you have a good base for your nutrition I think the easiest way to see results would be walks. Walk whenever you can for as long as you can, at first it may be short but you will see returns in your stamina relatively quickly as far as ""gains"" are concerned. If you're getting exhausted doing basic tasks, then basic tasks are a perfect place to start.

Most importantly, don't focus on your physique too much, gaining muscle mass and losing fat are two of the coveted and yet elusive aspects of fitness and it is foolish to start your journey to a healthier body at the last stage. Focus on little victories that actually improve your quality of life; maybe this time next month you can walk for a whole 10 minute before feeling winded. Anything is possible if you're diligent and take the appropriate first steps.

You think I'll just do a half hour of cardio and I'll be good and then 2 minutes in your dying and wondering how you can go 28 minutes longer. Then you leave the gym sad after burning 12 calories and you don't feel much like going back. Pick up some light weights and take breaks between sets. It's a nice leisurely pace. Then in a month or two after you've gained some strength and lost a few pounds from your diet, now when you try out cardio you will be setting yourself up for success and you won't be so easily discouraged. 
Bench-press, squat, deadlift, overhead press, and barbell row are compound lifts and incorporate every muscle (or almost every muscle) in your body. Nice way to get a full body workout and keeping it simple.",0

19765,"1. Write down EVERYTHING you put in your mouth, solid and liquid. ONLY to show you how much you are really eating. Being accountable for what you are eating is THE #1 tip. KNOW honestly what you are eating. No denials.  
Don't judge, because you are already going to be very hard on  yourself. Just BE AWARE...Woke, foodwise. Mindful.
2. Drink water. Not soda. Drinking water is not eating. Drinking water is a good substitute for eating. Even if you hate water, hate dieting more, and drink LOTS of water. That is the BIGGEST active change you can make.  


Those two things will carry you farther than anything else. One is mind, one is body.  
Being mindful will help you change your LIFE, food wise. By writing down everything that passes your lips, you will honestly have to admit what you ate that was not a good choice. You will have to be honest in how MUCH food you actually consume. Once you are honest with yourself,  you will be more mindful of trying to be consistent in your choices.

19767,"Hi, a great decision to make! YouTube is definitely a good place to start. You can search for both men and ladies strength training videos. First start by body weight. When you can do that comfortably, it might be a good idea to get a pair of adjustable dumbbells. I'm sorry i don't know what your gender is but even if you're a lady start with 2-3kg (is that like 5-6 pounds?) and gradually build up adding more weight.
Strength training is very important for both genders and will make you look great! 

I can't do a pull up either but i exercise on a bar too. First just hang there and try to hold yourself for 20-30 seconds. Then you can try to lift your knees to your chest, ""bicycle"" or circle your legs while you're hanging on the bar. There are YouTube videos showing how to do that.

In addition, it's a great idea to walk outdoors in the sun, bike, hike, dance or swim.

When you get fitter and feel comfortable with traditional exercise, you might consider looking into something called High intensity interval training (HIIT) which is very effective and recommended for weight loss. But i was only able to do it after a year of ""normal"" exercise when my body got used to movement.

Don't forget to eat plenty of protein! 

Good luck on your journey i hope you'll find something you enjoy!",0

19792,"Right now my plan is cardio 3 days a week (MWF), strength training 2 days a week (TuTh). and rest on the weekend. Making a schedule you can stick to is super helpful I find, just make sure to work in rest days -- your muscles generally need 24-48 hours to recover from a workout, which is why I like to alternate cardio &amp; strength days.

As for how often and how long to do each exercise, as long as you've got at least one exercise for each major muscle group it's entirely up to you how it's done. Start with 2-3 sets of 10 reps each and go from there, focus mainly on getting your form right. A full-length mirror really comes in handy here, or you could film yourself. If you're still not feeling confident in your form, I recommend asking a friend for help, or even getting a personal trainer/joining a class. Also, Google/Youtube is your friend here.

As for healthy meals, I second picking whatever diet works for you. Your meals should generally boil down to protein + starch + some kind of fruit/veggy  -- just tonight I made a stir fry with various veggies, a shitload of beans, and some curry paste. Simple, delicious and full of protein 👍. Since you work fulltime I really recommend using the weekend to meal prep (r/mealprep)

You don't have to worry about gaining weight as long as the calories you take in don't exceed the calories you burn, so if you stick to your exercise and maintain a diet of nutritious, whole foods, I don't think you should have anything to worry about. Fitness apps like MyFitnessPal help a lot with tracking calories, macros, etc.

Hope that helps!",0

19810,"Check out my fitness pal to maybe keep track of protein if you aren't interested in totally tracking calories. A good way to minimize sweets/processed foods is to increase protein. Helps keep you satiated. Holds on to lean body mass and gives you the best chance of losing more body fat. (.75grams per 1lb body weight would be a good place to start). If you find after a couple months you aren't losing then maybe consider plugging in your info online and getting an idea of your needed caloric intake per day, actively track your food, and shoot for a deficit of 250-500 calories per day to start. After a couple of weeks, reevaluate and adjust as needed. When it comes to exercise, weight lifting will help maintain muscle mass and help you look leaner when the fat comes off. If you really aren't interested, just walking is beneficial for your health and a-okay to do. Start at 30 minutes and work up to an hour or go on local hikes during the weekends. Whatever you can keep up and enjoy is what works for you. Last suggestion. Don't go over the top and try to lose too quickly. It makes it miserable, increases the chance for a binge/restrict cycle, and overall decreases the chance that the weight will stay off. If you take it week by week and pick one or two small thing to change (no soda and walk for 40 minutes 5x this week). It will become a natural change in your lifestyle and not a ""diet"".

19813,"First off you need to separate exercise from weight loss. Weight loss is acheived by fixing your nutrition. Simply choosing highly nutritious foods most of the time will do wonders for your weight and well being. If you want to get more precise, you eat less than you burn. Try MyFitnessPal for a week. Count your calories and you will likely find you are eating too much. Fix that first. Dont diet. Diets don't work for majority of people. (multiple studies have shown this). Keto, low carb, low fat. Fuck them all. Just choose foods that you like which are nutritious. Lean meats, veggies, fruits. 

Exercise is used to speed up the process and for other health benefits (being stronger, having strong cardiovascular health, etc). Pick a routine you like which you can stick to long term. I recommend something that focuses on strength, cardio, flexibility and mobility. Pilates, yoga, weights, and some cardio you enjoy is a good start.",0
19814,it's scary how quick it all adds up. seriously start logging your calories and it'll be mind opening!,0
19815,"Yeah, so maybe run a SLOW 1 mile 2x week to start? Then work your way up to 3-4x week. Up the distance. Stay slow. Work on your form, your breathing, your cadence.",0
19816,"If you want to take this advice, here’s what I would do 

1) Every night at a specific time see how many full pushups with a flat back and arms extended you can do. 

It may go 0-0-0-0-0-0–0-0-0-0-0-0-1-13. Don’t try 10 times per day, just once per day at the same time. 

But I want you to just try 

2) Then I want you to get used to the motion with knees on the ground or do Stair-pushups or the wall pushups as mentioned in the other comment.

3) to end each night, do forearm planks for 15-20 seconds 3-4 times (and make sure you breathe!) 

Take as much rest time as you need

As you get better at forearm planks (and add side planks), you can increase the time allotted + add other floor exercises. This will help build confidence for the next day when you see how many pushups you can do. 

Here’s my reasoning. Don’t view step one as a point of failure, but merely as a point of reference. 

You’re not competing against the entire planet, you are only holding yourself accountable. 

I swear to God that the first push-up you complete will be the sweetest victory, and in 2-3 months you’ll be able to crank out sets of 20 and be bored by it. 

Good luck!",0
19818,"Most of weight loss is about what you eat, not exercise. I'd recommend you use an app like MyFitnessPal and start tracking what you eat for a couple weeks.

My general advice is to go slower than you think you should.  Start slow, walk if you need to.

They're both good, but even for a regular runner,  most runs should be slow runs.",0

* Make it a 30-day challenge. Just do whatever for 30 days. You can say you're ""not allowed"" to skip twice in a row, but it gives you a goal.
* Lower the bar. What if your goal for exercising could be met by 5 pushups, against the wall, once a day? (or 10 jumping jacks every day, or a 15 minute walk 3 times a week) Would you be successful?
* Make it something fun. Dancing while listening to music. Meeting with friends and playing frisbee. Gamify the exercise. I miss the Wiifit...
* Get an accountability partner. A friend who guilts you if you don't meet them for weight lifting or yoga class.
* Try anything and everything. Feel free to quit. Join a running group. Take up martial arts.  Join an intramural soft ball team. Download that running app that has zombies chasing you. Learn how to swing dance. Find out what's happening in your local parks and recs department. Find a boxing gym. Join a gym and hire a trainer. Take up rock climbing. Learn how to play tennis.

I hope you will not let your selfperspective dictate by those who haven't struggled the struggle your struggling with.

These kind of people will always find something to be snarky about, even if you look absolutely perfect, your probably arrogant and selfrightious, or some other stuff which makes no sense.
They know they themself suck, it just hurts less when others suck a bit more, so they tend to go out their way to make that happen.

It often is indeed a tradeoff because when excersising, blood is needed elsewhere but the brain. (So the tradeoff is rather in the moment)

Try to catch yourself when making up excuses and waysout of things, you'll know when you bullshitting yourself for the sake of justifying.

I would try to get my heart rate up for two minutes and then bring it back down for the next two; then I would repeat that at first for 20 minutes. By the end of the month, I was able to do that for 45 minutes!

19888,"I’m no expert but maybe looking into breathing exercises can help. The Oxygen Advantage and Wim Hof Method would be a good place to start looking. Oxygen Advantage in particular lays out some ways to practice more efficient breathing that don’t require moving. 

Also maybe finding a gym that has an aquatic treadmill could be a good option. It would allow you to walk or run while only supporting a small amount of your body weight, thus being much easier on the legs

Lastly, diet is always very important for health and fitness but more so in this case

I could be wrong, if anyone has an example I'd be interested to learn.

Try finding a tennis partner, go back to playing soccer, play some table tennis or whatever sport you might enjoy. For me, just having some competitiveness helped me out with the lack of motivation.

Think about the last time you went to a store--now, how many of those people do you remember? Probably none (or maybe a couple if the same people have worked there for awhile).

People tend to focus on themselves and only pay attention to a stranger for a split second unless that person is somehow extremely interesting, unusual, or threatening. So, unless you're wearing a costume or carrying a knife, it's likely that most people aren't even really noticing you.",0

This same thing is true for everyone else.

I have a BMI of 21 or so but have been heavier before. Whenever I see an overweight person doing some kind of sports I always cheer them on in my mind because I know how much harder it is to just make yourself get up and get going, not to mention go running or just walking when you have additional weight to carry around with you.

Honestly, there's absolutely nothing you should be ashamed of or embarrassed about. It's those who - for whatever reasons, because I can't think of any - carry negative thoughts about people who're trying to be healthy who should be ashamed of themselves, and I wouldn't hesitate to tell them so should I ever witness someone laughing at a person trying to do their body and soul a big favour by exercising, no matter how fast or how slow or out of breath they are.

19938,"Hey first of all!! good job, you're putting in a lot of work already, that's really amazing.

2- you might never be not shy or self conscious but... Getting out there and being confident that you're working on being the best you?! Even if other people are mean, don't give that kind of negative shit room in your head! 

Alternatively- find some trails and start trail running. There's a few good apps. It's much more relaxing than the concrete/stoplights. Parks, state, federal parks. ""All trails"" is decent! It's a log-in app  but free. 

- find a really casual running club! It might help to go with other people (and some who will probably be marathoner's!) In a large group who will likely want to support you, it's a great way to get feedback, be around healthy people (who won't laugh at you for wanting to be healthy....!) And maybe make some new friends. 

- just go... Start with like a mile or 2 (or whatever set a time limit) and just go!!! .. Broad daylight. Soak up the sun and enjoy it, face the fear. It's usually worse in our mind than it turns out to be! 


I'm always impressed when people make changes, and form new habits out of sheer will. I really hope you can get out there.(the night jog is a great start!!)

I know that it's easier said than done, and it definitely takes time to build that confidence, but everything good in life comes with you pushing yourself out of your comfort zone.

This is what I do:
1. The quote about ‘lapping everyone on the couch’ you’re out exercising, everyone else is just nipping out to get milk or go shopping. Go YOU!
2. No one knows what you’re planning. You could be out for a 10mile run or just a power walk round the block. Don’t worry about how out of breath you are or stoping to walk. You’re out there doing it! If having a little walk makes you enjoy it more then have a bloody walk!
3. Once you get to a certain point in your run you’re going to feel like you can rule the world. Add that to the achievement of being nervous but doing it anyway- mate!! You’ll be unstoppable. 

I know you’ll still be uneasy- I’m already dreading my run today! But put on load music and look straight ahead. Ignore them. I promise PROMISE you the majority of people aren’t judging they’re thinking ‘Jesus, good on her’

I guess my main point is that and are cool but they don't necessarily signal anything about health.  And health is way more important than getting a certain look.",0

19991,"ALWAYS. I vape prior to every workout. I primarily do weights and jump rope.  Ive tried a variety of strains and find a hybrid to work best...a high thc indica can feel too heavy and sativas don’t cut my chronic pain that much. My favourite preworkout combo is my home grown Grape Ape (indica forward hybrid) with Furious Grape BCAAs. It’s like a fabulously tasty wine pairing. 

Weed helps tame my pain or muscle soreness from a prior workout so I can actually go to the gym and be productive. It makes for better stretching and I have laser sharp focus on my form. It improves my mind-muscle connection, where I can better feel/visualize the muscle(s) I’m working on. Its possible that I might be just perceiving these things improving but who cares when it’s not doing any harm. I also love that music is more immersive and helps me get one the zone’ so to speak. 

Believe it or not I also make better nutrition choices after but that’s likely because I’m not new to the effects of cannabis. When I use my preworkout vape I tell myself that the workout is only half of the task at hand (nutrition being the other).",0
19992,"The recovery needs to match the workout program. A heavy weight lifting session or high intensity cardio session will stress the body more than light workouts. If you enjoy high intensity training I would suggest limiting yourself to 3 high intensity sessions per week. However, it is not ideal to take the other 4 days completely off. Recovery workouts (light loads, low intensity cardio, stretching, foam rolling) will help reduce soreness and help your body recover quicker. If you don’t like high intensity workouts you can workout at low or moderate intensities every day.",0

I too would also suggest yoga. Use yoga blocks for everything. You can’t reach your toes? Grab 2 yoga blocks and place them in front of your feet on the highest level so you can bring the floor closer to you. 

Also, if you practice some type of “vinyasa” or “ashtanga” you practice by moving with your breath which helps you control it. I can say I feel like my lung capacity has def increased because of it. You can get a good cardio workout. YouTube has a large selection of yoga classes.",0

You can't think as far ahead about how long it will take you to finish you literally can only focus on what you are doing at the moment. 

Secondly, I have noticed when I am a certain level of tired at the gym I kind of am able to do more because I'm just pushing through and it all sucks anyway so why not add more weight.

20017,"I feel u on preferring to workout alone, the only time I like a workout partner is if I’m doing exercises where having a spotter is necessary. For example, when bench pressing it’s a lot more efficient to have a spotter to be there so u can attempt reps that you wouldn’t otherwise attempt if there wasn’t a ‘safety net’. For me there’s a noticeable difference in my chest days when I go with a spotter versus without one. 

About the form: having good form is extremely important and it is something that comes with experience and research. Start by looking up the exercises that you are doing and pay close attention to the exact way they perform each repetition. There are many videos out there that focus on teaching the correct way to do each and every exercise. You know you have the right form when you can feel the targeted muscles doing all the work and only those targeted muscles, not any other muscles or movements. Having bad form can lead to improper muscle growth and injuries. For example, when doing standing preacher curls, you may feel the urge to use your back muscles to propel your arms up and help you complete the rep. This can lead to back injury and your biceps are doing less work. Move to lower weight and focus on having the correct form then your muscles will grow naturally and you will be able to work your way up in weight.",0

20079,"You're not going to hurt yourself or anything, it's not going to be very effective.  When you're a novice, pretty much anything that feels challenging will help, but once you get past novice gains you need to learn how to program: how to manipulate variables like intensity (how heavy), volume (total number of reps), frequency (how often), and so on.  And when you are trying to force your body to adapt and get bigger and stronger, it's less effective to try and ride two bikes with one ass.  If you want to do high volume/light weights and work on endurance, great.  If you want to do high intensity and lower volume to maximize strength, great.  But you're better off doing blocks of training (4-8 weeks) of something, rather than mixing them up in the same workout.

In place of what you're doing, I would suggest trying to get stronger/more fit.  Try improving over time, either adding weight or adding reps/sets to do more volume.  If you want to be bigger, you want to work your way up to 50lb dumbbells, not randomly down.

Cold Thermogenesis: How Low Temperatures Boost Long-Term Health
What do drinking chilled water, taking a cold shower, and polar bear plunges all have in common? They’re all examples of cold thermogenesis, or therapeutic cold exposure.

Immersing in freezing water may be uncomfortable, but exposing yourself to cold temperatures can boost metabolism and ward off disease. Cold exposure is also important for regulating body fat levels and can help promote healthy weight management.

In the same way that we get goosebumps or start to shiver when we’re chilly, thermogenesis is another bodily response to cold. Since it’s internal, however, many people don’t know the ways it benefits the body beyond keeping it warm. Here’s how cold thermogenesis works, plus what it can do for your long-term health.

What Is Cold Thermogenesis?

Thermogenesis is a way we produce heat to keep our bodies warm. Cold thermogenesis kicks this process into overdrive. When you’re exposed to colder environments, your body works harder to maintain homeostasis and regulate core temperature. It produces more energy to stay warm, burning calories to produce that heat. This in turn stimulates metabolism. Hormones involved in body temperature regulation also play a role in stimulating heat-related fat breakdown, including epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones.

White and Brown Fat

Cold thermogenesis influences metabolism because it stimulates brown adipose tissue (BAT), also known as brown fat. Adiponectin, or brown fat gets its color from high levels of iron.

The other type of fat in the body is white fat — the fat type people are most commonly familiar with. White fat helps insulate the organs, but too much can be unhealthy.

The body looks to brown fat to stay warm because it provides body heat without causing shivering. The side effect of this heat production is that it helps the body burn fat to promote fat loss. It also lowers the heart rate, burns calories, and promotes weight loss. The fat burning power of brown fat makes it a potential treatment for obesity and metabolic diseases.

Benefits of Cold Thermogenesis

Cold thermogenesis: a woman in the snow

Cold exposure, also known as cryotherapy, is the act of intentionally exposing oneself to cold environments to promote health. In addition to stimulating metabolism and burning white fat, there are many cold thermogenesis health benefits.

Both short-term and long-term benefits abound. Cold thermogenesis benefits often become evident immediately after intentional cold exposure, and people tend to feel happier and more energized after immersion in cold water.

Here’s an overview of how cold thermogenesis benefits the mind and body in the long term.

Brain Health

The breakdown of brain synapses, or degeneration, is a normal side effect of aging. It causes cognitive decline, memory loss, and diseases like alzheimer’s and parkinsons. However, exposure to cold stimulates cold shock proteins, which in turn decrease degeneration. Dr. Rhonda Patrick describes cold thermogenesis as “the link between synapse regeneration,” and says, “cold exposure and cold shock proteins may pose as significant puzzle pieces into combatting cellular degeneration and aging.”

Immunity

Exposing yourself to cold environments (like ice baths) on a regular basis may also boost immunity. Patrick explains that the cold increases white blood cell count as well as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which help combat cancer cells.

Cold thermogenesis also boosts immune function by decreasing inflammation and allowing the body to heal more quickly. The immunity-boosting effects of cold thermogenesis can also be tied to its ability to stimulate norepinephrine release. This causes “an increase in natural killer cell count and activity, and a rise in circulating levels of interleukin 6, all of which can massively improve your immune system integrity,” according to Julie Shanebrook.

Sleep

Cold therapy has also been shown to improve sleep, ability to fall asleep, and depth and quality of sleep. One study found that just three minutes of whole body cryotherapy improves objective and subjective sleep quality in healthy active people. This could be due to the fact that pain relief and parasympathetic nervous system activity increased during slow wave sleep (SWS).

Resiliency and Recovery

Cold thermogenesis: a woman exercising

More athletes are turning to cold thermogenesis to promote recovery and reduce workout-related fatigue. This is because total body cold immersion results in the nervous system creating vasoconstriction, which narrows the arteries and blood vessels. This reduces blood flow to damaged muscles, in turn reducing inflammation and mitigating the onset of swelling and bruising.

“Whole-body cryotherapy offers a technological and scientific approach to addressing fatigue, delayed muscle recovery, as well as pain and inflammation caused by rigorous training and exercise,” says Willie Mueller at Cryozone.

Cryotherapy Methods

Not everyone will benefit from cryotherapy, so it’s important to talk to your doctor before starting it. Cold showers and ice baths are some of the most common ways to stimulate cold thermogenesis. Dipping a body part, such as your head, into cold water can also spark metabolism if you’re not ready to immerse your whole body. Cold baths have been shown to offer more benefits after endurance training rather than strength training, but more research is needed.

Sleeping in a cold room is another way to induce cold thermogenesis, and it may be easier than dunking in an ice bath. One study showed that a month of exposure to cold temperatures during sleep increased brown fat in healthy men. It also improved insulin sensitivity, suggesting that a cold environment may support people with impaired glucose metabolism or prediabetes.

Ice Baths and the Wim Hof Method

Cold thermogenesis: a man floating in cold water

Neurosurgeon and paleo expert Jack Kruse offers a few tips for starting a cold thermogenesis routine at home. Before starting, he suggests drinking 16-32 ounces of water and eating a high-fat or high-protein meal. Next get a bucket of water that’s 50-55 degrees and dunk your face in, holding for as long as you can. He says to continue for a few weeks until you can hold for longer.

Another method is to take an ice bath in cold water with 20lbs of ice on your chest. Wear socks, gloves, a t-shirt and a hat to keep the body warm until it adjusts. Then you can take the outer protection off. Stay for 45 minutes. In both instances, it’s important that you don’t allow your skin temperature to fall below 50-55 degrees.

These methods follow the Wim Hof method, as Dave Asprey of Bulletproof explains. The Wim Hof method works to stimulate the vagus nerve, which is connected to the rest of the nervous system. In turn, exposing even just your face to cold water can give you these benefits while increasing tolerance to cold environments.

Additional Wim Hof research has shown cryotherapy to improve concentration, willpower, and sleep while reducing depression and autoimmune symptoms. These benefits can play a vital role in a person’s mental health. “The method helps you to increase mental resilience, which allows you to better deal with daily stressors. It also increase your focus, concentration and willpower, which are all very important factors for good mental health,” says Wim Hof.

Cold Thermogenesis and Long-Term Health

Cold thermogenesis is a popular health trend aimed at supporting long-term wellbeing through exposure to cold. Immersing either the whole body or certain body parts in cold environments stimulates the burning of white fat, the increase of brown fat, and a boost in metabolism.

Cryotherapy methods have also been shown to improve muscle recovery, boost immunity, and improve brain health. Cold thermogenesis can help you understand sleep and recovery, and have a lasting impact on your ability to lead a happy, disease-free life.",0

This says if you take a particularly part of the adipose tissue *in a test tube* and *freeze it*, the tissue breaks down.

Abstract
Brown and beige adipocytes are characterised as expressing the unique mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP)1 for which the primary stimulus in vivo is cold exposure. The extent to which cold-induced UCP1 activation can also be achieved in vitro, and therefore perform a comparable cellular function, is unknown. We report an in vitro model to induce adipocyte browning using bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which relies on differentiation at 32 °C instead of 37 °C. The low temperature promoted browning in adipogenic cultures, with increased adipocyte differentiation and upregulation of adipogenic and thermogenic factors, especially UCP1. Cells exhibited enhanced uncoupled respiration and metabolic adaptation. Cold-exposed differentiated cells showed a marked translocation of leptin to adipocyte nuclei, suggesting a previously unknown role for leptin in the browning process. These results indicate that BM-MSC can be driven to forming beige-like adipocytes in vitro by exposure to a reduced temperature. This in vitro model will provide a powerful tool to elucidate the precise role of leptin and related hormones in hitherto functions in the browning process",0

20108,"I’m going to share what worked for me starting out, hope the advice helps. I started with walking. I walked at a speed that I could do for 30 minutes and worked up a sweat by the end. I started to add incline and did intervals at a faster walking pace. This went on for about 5 months with increasing time and speed (not both at the same time). I was able to use that as my form of exercise primarily with occasional elliptical and biweekly general weight lifting to add variety. 

Then I went home for the summer and started to try out jogging. It started with a lot of short bouts of jogging and a lot of walking in between. By the time I was halfway through summer break I could run 2 miles outside in the heat without a break. 

Now I’m not super consistent, but ever since then I’ve been able to pick up jogging and can work up to a 5k with no breaks within a week or two of starting back up consistently again. Even if I don’t work out for a few weeks at all, I’m able to jump on the treadmill and jog a good chunk of the time.",0
20109,"I have a stupid question about this, so please forgive me. 
I ride my bike, 30 KMs a day a few times a week (3-4), and do weights a couple of days a week. 

Does this kind of fitness translate to other cardio activities like running? Or is each sport/action unique to the body?",0
20110,"Tough one;

Runners high seems to be a phenomenon that comes with more practice. That ones more like euphoria and you will for sure notice it when it happens

Then there’s the general sense of wellbeing after the run which is pretty reliable these days and for some reason strongest the whole day following

But back to the beginning; shit I’m not sure. I think possibly it may have felt pretty awful during and maybe for a bit after as the body really isn’t used to it, but then there may have been an uptick in mood / confidence present afterward but I may not have been as aware of it. 

Other phenomena are flow states which can be induced with runs / exercise in general 

Then there’s your general increased insights into problems that come from running (can come from just walking too but I find it more noticeable with something more intense)",0
20111,Did you always feel good after runs?,0
20112,"God I remember the first time I started running. It’s weird to even think about that now!

But yeah the old adage of pushing through and slowly escalating the amount that you run is really all there is to if

You don’t need to pressure yourself to follow a routine as that’s a quick way to make yourself not want to do it. 

Just get out there and go for a run and trust in the body’s ability to adapt and eventually enjoy it. Learn to love how good you feel after the run. Learn to love how good it feels to be able to think clearer, have more boodflow to the regions of the brain associated with higher functioning tasks, learn to love the inceeased energy and even sociability you will feel. Get addicted to that!

If I don't get exercise my back hurts after a few days but when I'm active I sleep normally and wake without any pain.

20171,"while I (20f) don't know of a specific program that builds up ab workouts like C25K (which I also enjoy), my advice for people with motivation issues is to develop a consistent routine. Although most people go to the gym/exercise because they're motivated, even the most enthusiastic people WILL run out of motivation at some point. People continue to exercise anyway after that, some people because they're incredibly disciplined but personally I think consistency is routine is more reasonable to keep up. If you get in the habit of doing exercises on a schedule, at a certain time (ie mon/wed/fri morning, every other evening, five days of the week) then your body will be ready to do it even if you really don't feel like it. 

It may also help to make a plan for the week so you know what you have to get done. If you're not used to a plan already and are trying to make up stuff the day of, that will discourage you because you have to spend extra energy coming up with what you're going to do that day. Instead sit down when you do get bursts of motivation and plan out some routines you can choose from when you actually do exercise. Example: side plank 30sec each side, 12 v-sits, 15 Russian twists, repeat 3 times with 30sec rest between rounds. And if it's too easy or difficult after one day, you can just adjust the reps or rest time. 

Overall stomach/hip shaping is really hard, and a lot of it relies on your eating habits way more than your exercising. You can do ab workouts every single day but if you don't eat a certain way, you won't see much change. 

Here's what I do for an ab circuit: 12 v-sits, 15 Russian twists, side plans 30sec each side, commandos, repeated 30sec rest between rounds. I usually do it with a medicine ball and after some other lifting. Consider doing some of these with a weight/medicine ball (anywhere from 6-12lb) in your hands, but if you're really averse to buying a weight you could find whatever else in your house that's kind of heavy (like a gallon of water or a bag of rice).",0

When I lose weight, it comes off from the chest first, then abdomen, and then the love handles are a sonofabitch to get rid of.

It’s also the same brand college crew teams use/abuse plus many gyms.

Cites three general states or zones of training - 1. Green (low to moderate intensity) 2. Yellow (medium intensity, some strain, but manageable still) and 3. Red (high intensity, huffing and puffing type). Goes on to point that the best endurance athletes train in the green zone. Says you don't have to necessarily train in the red zone to experience gains. What matters is the persistence and discipline to train. I'm paraphrasing of course. And this is what i understood of the talk. Have a look at the video. Point is that you just need to get ur ass to train or to the gymn and be consistent and discplined about it. It doesn't have to be an ordeal.",0

Many people begin exercising with the idea that you need to push yourself as far as you can when you exercise, that you need to be out of breath and that exercise has to feel uncomfortable to get the best results. It makes many people develop an unhelpful aversion toward exercise, leading to inconsistent exercise or complete cessation of it.

Deadlifts, however, are prime glute and hamstring drivers.

Skating is the best movement for glutes. Its dynamic, drives the legs rearward, and gives a good cardio boost, too

Of course theres bridges and other specific isolators, but how boring is that?

Also, why cant you squat?",0

20322,"Hey, glad you're hopping on the exercise train! 

I would start simple and slow, because if you over work yourself it can end up badly causing you to be decommissioned for quite some time if the injury is bad enough.

With that being said, start with the basics. Try doing 10 pushups, see if you can do 3 sets of 10. Crunches for abs and squats for legs. These are the basic fundamentals.

Do you have access to a gym?",0
20323,That's going to be difficult to estimate (although I like u/taco-tsunami 's suggestion to do so via an average heart rate). The question I have is: why do you want to know? Is it just a matter of curiousity or are you planning to use that number to eat those calories back?,0
20324,"All good tips so far. The most important thing to understand is that a good 80% to 90% of the changes you're looking for will come from your diet. As you're looking to gain weight, you'll want to be in a caloric surplus- meaning you'll want to consume slightly more calories than you're burning each day.

You'll also want to get enough protein in to facilitate that muscle growth. 0.8 g / lb of your body weight is a good amount. You can go higher if you'd really like to err on the high side.

Next, you need to create the stimulus to encourage muscle growth. That comes from stressing your muscles just enough to encourage growth- a process known as ""progressive overload"".

Depending on what you feel up to, squats and push-ups in the morning as just part of your wake up routine can be really quick (or in the evening if you're a ""I need to be out the house in 5 minutes"" person). I like the Nerd Fitness website for beginning stuff, look up circuit training for ideas of exercises you can do at home.

20418,"Dang bro I know you're pain in regards to the meal plan. I'm a college student too and but I was glad to get off of it after freshman year bc the food choices are terrible at my school. If you can afford to get some groceries, scrambled eggs is like THE meal that most fitness/nutrition ppl would recommend for the first meal of the day, and you can eat that every single day, add a slice or 2 of peanut butter toast...should have you feeling great. And eggs are like a dollar for a week or two supply. Ground chicken is another really healthy and simple meal that you can fry if you have access to an oven top, but if you live on campus at the moment it sounds like making your own meals may not really be possible. Just start slow with the workouts. You shouldn't be going 100% every day at the beginning or your body simply won't be able to recover, the recovery is where the body physically improves. So try to go about 75%. It should be something you look forward to, not comfortable, but not killing yourself each time. Wish you luck man hope this helps!",0

Lately friends have been treating me to meals at restaurants that I really like (healthy options mostly, but probably more calories than I should be eating), because there’s nothing on campus. Usually I can eat the whole meal and then some, but now I can’t even finish the meal. I also haven’t been craving anything at all this week.

Work on eccentric calf raises...ie up on your toes on both feet down on just the bad foot 20 times... And work on balance type exercises.

Thiccness can be achieved regardless of the hip dip, if you can build muscle mass around your glutes. 

Gymming is about health and self-improvement, and naturally includes the improvement of our physical appearance. But it’s important to recognise that there are some parts of our bodies that we must learn to love exactly the way they are. 

Otherwise you risk falling into the trap of eternally chasing a false ideal of perfection, which can stop you from being comfortable in your own skin.

TLDR: Sorry if this isn’t what you want to hear, but you can’t change hip dips, so think of them as something that makes you unique rather than a negative (because they are not). Bone structure is as much a natural part of you as your skin and eye colour.",0

To answer your question: you can't rely on motivation. If your diet and lifestyle are tuned then you won't have to make yourself. You'll want to run, jump, lift and do physical activity. Plenty of water, enough protein, supplements, enough sleep etc. If you're vegan go carnivore, if you're carnivore go vegan. If you're low fat go high fat. Change stuff up until you get where you need to be. There is no one right way. Trial and error to see what works

Abandon your goals.

With a goal you exist in a perpetual state of failure until you reach the goal. I.E. Your NOT 160lbs until you reach the goal. You fail daily for every day that you're not 160. That's freaking harsh, and nothing is more demotivating. Reaching a goal is very demotivating and anti-climactic. Systems beat goals.

Systems versus Goals

[https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/dilbert-s-scott-adams-on-why-it-s-better-to-have-a-system-than-a-goal.html](https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/dilbert-s-scott-adams-on-why-it-s-better-to-have-a-system-than-a-goal.html)

For  exercise I felt the same as you. Here's what I did. I set up a system,  rather than a goal. Everyday at 10am I exercise for 5minutes. No more no  less. If I do that everyday I can be happy with myself knowing I've  made progress. What happens 9 times out of 10 is that I end up  exercising for an hour. BUT if I don't that's fine too! The system  works.

Another trick is to  associate the the habit with something you love. So for the 5minutes I  have set aside to exercise each day I watch a livestream of someone who I  love to listen to. You can make it anything, just do something else  that you love while you're practicing the habit. This is why workout  buddy systems are so effective. That's just another type of system. You  can listen to music, watch a show ... it can be anything, anything that  you enjoy and can do at the same time. adding a reward at the end like a  piece of chocolate will set up a dopamine ""hit"" that also drives your  motivation.

As you up the weight lifted your recovery may start slowing down. That's when you'll want to switch programs and split it further. Certain compound lifts hit different muscles harder so maybe after a few weeks of squats you switch to front squats. Or deadlift to sumo deadlift.

One last question if you don’t mind: how many different exercises should I be doing per workout?

I’m thinking I just need to hit each muscle at least one (or twice/three times if I really want to build it). So since I’m doing an upper/lower split, on one day I need to do an exercise that hits my traps, lats, deltoids, triceps, biceps, chest, and abs. Multiple of these can be hit at one time with certain compound exercises, so maybe I’ll only end up doing 5-10 different exercises in a given day. Does that sound sufficient?",0

How much weight, reps and sets will come with experience. As long as you keep a record somewhere you can see what works for you. Half the fun for me is tweaking rep ranges and charting progress. Can start with a base program on one of the many subreddits (maybe bodybuilding?) And work off that.

20524,"I have seen some results. I'm definitely getting stronger, but I'm not sure how much progress I should be seeing when I'm only about 5 weeks into the plan. What makes it inferior to a plan with barbells too, besides obviously the wider range of exercises?",0
20525,I always ran track and cross country back in high school but i was never a sprinter i would do middle to long distance. Mostly just looking for extra tips and knowledge you can’t get reading a workout chart or watching a video. Thanks for replying!,0
20526,"Not ideal. Are you seeing results? If yes, then it’s effective if not then it’s not effective.",0
20527,Way to go! This is the best way to look at it for sure.,0
20528,"yes, i feel that i have been consistent in my lifting. my only concern is that i’m following a dumbbell only plan, as the only means i have to lift are at home. i have a wide variety of weight, but my only question is is a dumbbell only plan effective",0
20529,"Keep it up, son!",0
20530,"So I guess it really is that different from person to person. I found a website that said 8-12 was ideal for hypertrophy (at least 8, should definitely fail before 12), but it didn’t specify if that should change based on whether you’re doing isolation or compound workouts.

I haven’t been *consistently* hitting the gym for a little over a year now, so I’m gonna start on the lighter side to get a feel for things.

I always get confused with the technical side of things. How many reps/sets, how much weight, how many unique workouts, best routine split, should I alternate between routines.... stuff like that (not asking you to answer all that haha)",0
20531,It’s not about weather you see progress or not right away . It’s about following a plan and being patient for results.  Good habits give you results.,0
20532,Also you can speed recovery with salt baths and protein,0
20533,"Best exercise for losing fat is walking. After that I would suggest sprinting. They are the best for losing weight. Jogging and running, they are going to make you hungry and probably you are gonna eat after that more calories than you burned. Gym is not for losing fat is for gaining muscle. Weight training helps a lot losing fat , but if you do it right you will gain muscle. Also people are trying to bulk and they have trouble with it so you won’t wake up one morning with huge muscular quads. So yeah walk around daily for 1.5-2 hours, do 8 sprints, eat on a caloric deficit and you will see results.",0
20534,"Ok, thank you. I feel like I'm not making much progress, but when I look at pictures from even a couple months ago I can see a difference. I'll definitely keep that in mind. Do you have any more advice?",0
20535,Yes that is high rep. Keep that up and be patient. Also try doing some of those exercises seated if possible to take some pressure off of your back.,0
20536,"That's what I've heard. My dad has been lifting for years now, and he's stressed the importance of form. I always try to keep the weight to a point where I can get good form, and then progress as necessary. All the exercises I do are in the 8-15 rep range, would you consider that to be high rep?",0
20537,The biggest issue I see with beginners (especially young kids) in the gym is that they don't focus on technique. That is the most important part of the exercise. Technique will keep you from getting hurt and will help you grow faster while getting stronger. I've been playing sports and working out my whole life (42M) and I am still learning. There are a few guys I follow on IG that always have good stuff to share. They don't ego lift but are all in great shape. Also be open to ways to exercise that are lighter weight more reps. You will get pretty much the same results because at your age your body won't allow you to bulk up yet.,0
20539,"Download my fitness pal app, put in ho much weight you want to lose and consume how many calories it tells you to consume.",0
20540,Can't just lose fat in one spot short of medical intervention. If you just want to lose fat and not put on any muscle then do cardio and restrict calories. Putting on muscle is harder than people think though.,0
20541,"Yes it is. I’ll eat to compensate for being depressed and the dining hall with it’s unhealthy options doesn’t help. Compiled with academic pressure I’ve fallen in to “reward myself” eating because why eat healthy when there’s all this unhealthy food that tastes better, plus I deserve it for working hard, right? It’s a bad mindset but as long as I’m on a meal plan there’s no way around it.",0
20542,It’s pretty much all diet. Do some cardio and clean up your diet. It’s a myth that people accidentally find themselves too bulky. It takes a lot of time and effort to put on muscle. You will not do it by accident.,0
20543,"Personally I found less reps for compound lifts but heavier weight more beneficial than increased reps (at least until plateauing). I kept a relatively high rep range for isolation though (which I do after compound lifts). I found 5 reps of heavy weight decent but that might be too few depending on you.

Different people respond differently to different amounts at different times in their lifting life.

How heavy are you lifting? Do you feel like you have gas left in the tank at the end of an session? How are you progressing?",0
20544,"I’m curious as to how long that took you and how you expect to have time to maintain this amount of activity. 30 miles is a lot for someone who has not worked out in at least half a decade. Start off with 3-5 miles a day. Aim for a 7 minute mile. That is a nice  challenging pace for someone who has been a couch potato, and you should have enough time to do it 5-6 days a week. 

You could do 3 miles before work (20ish minutes for ride, stretching before and cool down after might as well say 30 minutes workout total ) and 5 miles after work (35ish minutes for ride, stretching and cool down 45 minutes total). Ride to music with a fast beat, and soon enough you’ll be able to increase and maintain a much faster pace. 

If you don’t work, just schedule it as you please of course",0
20545,"So happy I'm not alone in this. I hate it but I feel it's how I became wired overall. I eat because I'm depressed, then I'll feel guilty the next and go way below my actual suggested calorie count. It's a damn vicious cycle, right?",0
20546,"It's ok you just have DOMS (Delayed onset muscle soreness). Recover for a few days then don't go 30 miles. Try 5 miles and work your way up over a month or two. Take it slow, you are in recovery from a sedentary lifestyle. You need to slowly rehabilitate. Creatine will help by keeping your muscles hydrated",0

20548,My pee is actually clear as I drink 3 liters of water per day!! I just looked at that condition and its scary that something like that can happen!!!,0
20549,I feel you there. I counter my binge eating by intermittent fasting but earlier in the semester my eating was uncontrollable and I gained 10 pounds but I stopped myself before it got of out hand. I’ll go days from eating a caloric excess to eating below 1000 calories.,0
20550,"You exercised muscles that you haven't been exercising. On top of that it's legs. This is normal. Give it a couple days, then dial it back a bit.",0
20551,I'm dealing with the same problem but I'm definitely not at a healthy weight.  I gained a new appreciation for food. Binge eating for a day then eating nothing at all until dinner the next day/night. It's hard to fall into shit when everything seriously hurts. I will walk on a treadmill maybe twice a week if I'm not depressed.,0
20552,"Okay, thanks for the answer",0
20553,"Soreness just means muscles have worked harder than they're used to or in a different way. Doesn't necessarily mean you are getting stronger or that you need to workout more intensely when you don't feel sore. Though, as you workout more, you will most likely encounter less and less bouts of soreness because your body will be used to the stress of an exercise routine. 

You could feel sore the first time you have worked out or the 200th time. Depends on the activity and how used your body is to the muscles worked during the activity.",0
20554,Find a HIIT running regimen to use. Also breathing properly is important. Find a 200 or 400 meter track runners training program to mimic. Just a few suggestions. When I was younger and in the army I was in Turbo PT and was the road guard (to keep the pace) for my group who basically sprinted 2 miles. While in basic I trained to get faster with a battle buddy that ran track for UCLA before joining.,0
20555,"HIIT is great and you can lose a lot of it but stay on a good diet with the fasting or you will hurt your progress more than help. You will need to replace all those vital nutrients you use up. Also make sure to take some amino acids for recovery everyday because it will be tough to fully recover and feel balanced after a training session without them. Lastly, make sure to switch up the types of HIIT you do so you don't end up injured because of overworked muscles and joints. Now DO WORK!!!",0
20556,Padded bike shorts are a great investment. Don’t let this one experience stop you from working out. Just build up more gradually—remember some soreness is expected even then.,0

Then increment by a mile a day or however you feel comfortable without killing your legs. It will take about a week or two for you to build up to biking maybe 20 miles a session and it will feel like youre not doing enough. Consistency and quality are much better than quantity.

20615,Abs are made in the kitchen!! Keep up the exercise! Now focus of calorie deficit while eat Whole Foods.,0
20616,The best advice I can give is this.  Continue cardio but focus more on strength training.  I would recommend starting with some basic weight training exercises to develop repetition and consistency.  Your body will start to get used to the exercises and then learn new exercises to target specific areas of the body.  Continue consistent workouts and slowly adopt new exercises adding to your routine.  I can’t stress diet enough as improved diet is the most important aspect.,0
20617,"You’re doing great on the exercise side! But I’ve found the easiest thing to do for losing fat is : caloric restriction. Diet diet diet. Exercise will help you lose weight faster along with diet, but sometimes just working out isn’t enough. 


A lot of people are saying to focus on strength. And it’s true, build more muscle and you will burn more calories in theory. But it tends to be much easier to cut first ( lose the weight and body fat) and THEN bulk. It’s supremely difficult to lose body fat and gain muscle at the same time. 

Keep at it! Try cutting an additional 300-400 calories out of your daily diet. ( say you eat 1800 a day. Try to cut it down to 1500) Work out how ever you like to. Don’t forget to stretch afterwards! Most people overlook mobility.",0
20618,"Focus on strength. Having a good base of muscle will not only make you look and feel better, it will make your metabolism faster which will make it easier to lose excess body fat. The main thing you need to look at is diet though. A common saying is that ""you can't out-exercise a bad diet"". If you want to lose body fat, cut. If you're new, you can still gain muscle on a cut. Keep up the good work though.",0

20623,This looks genius!,0
20624,Not necessarily there is no scientific measure for what Is considered “hollow”. I say hollow because the focus is engaging the entire core with the resistance up stream and down stream from the core. Because of this level of resistance you really need to focus on bracing the tru k hard which can result in a mild banana or “hollow” type position...I think for some this look will be obvious and others it’s not.,0
20625,"So many people making random suggestions as if they’re certain. And only answer I see mentioning fasting

Fasting is your best bet. Not just eating at a caloric deficit but completely abstaining from eating for *at least* 12 consecutive hours each day. This is how you direct your body to focus on metabolizing fat stores. It’s why obese people who go on week-, month-, or even year-long fasts (yes, it’s been done) don’t have loose skin afterwards. It’s why people who are starved (think pictures of Jews liberated from concentration camps) don’t have any bellies. 

Your fat stores are your body’s emergency energy supply and it does not want to give them up frivolously. You need to trick your body into thinking you’re at risk of starving if you don’t burn off that fat. That means you need to *fast*. Read up at r/fasting or r/IntermittentFasting to learn how to ease into it and do it healthily",0

There are so many things going on that it turns into a full-body exercise.

 Simply having a stronger core won't heal your back pain but building endurance in the musculature and knowing how to keep the trunk engaged when moving is a totally different thing.   

Learn how to modify this exercise to fit your goals whether it is pain relief or just to give your trunk a brutal exercise to build on.

You don't have posture issues. I don't know how someone could make that claim while they watch someone holding 60-70 lbs on their chest like that. Sure form can always be tweaked and I believe strong clean reps are far better than sloppy ones but all in all, it looks solid.

20675,"Simple answer yes. Slightly longer answer, not enough to lose weight without dieting or doing insane levels of exercise. Like 3 hours of cycling or something with intervals at some moderate resistance. 

Say your maintenance calories (calories require to neither gain nor lose weight is 1600ish calories, but you eat 2,400 calories a day or more. To lose weight you need to eat at a deficit of 300-500 calories a day. So you'd need to consume 1300 to 1100 calories a day. This means if you're only trying to burn those calories you'd have to cycle 1100 to 1300 calories a day. That's like 3-4 hours of cycling a day (high resistance/interval style) or 5-6 hours a day at a nice and easy pace.

And that's if you don't consume more than the aforementioned caloric amount. So you'd still have to keep track of your calories every day. Plus when machines tell you how many calories you've burned its still only a rough estimate with little accuracy. So there's no telling how many calories you've actually burned.",0

2. After you apply path goal theory in your mind please write down it on paper and take photograph on smartphone and set as wallpaper. And paste paper where you can see it most of time. This affect your subconsious mind.
3. Now make the diet plan and workout plan to clear the path of achieve goal and also write it on paper. Follow the diet and workout according to plan only.
4. After making plan, now comes the most difficult step which is taking action according to plan without loosing hope.
Tip- don't listen to mind or heart after making plan. Only listen of your paper in which you make plan.

Shoulders forward, maybe there is some confusion with a developed upper back and hunching forward.

Goblin squat or Goblet squat, there is no such thing in this video, it's a double kettlebell racked squat.

Extend the neck while doing this and shoulders should be “back” making them parallel with your torso and each other with the should blades down. I noticed your shoulders hunching forward during the that first lift from the ground(I know your holding them off the ground). It’s the same as deadlift. You gotta start when you bend of with shoulder back and shoulder blades down and that gold region holding that form locked in tight. Same with the head posture. Anyways when you bring them back down after holding them you throw your head back and chin toward the ceiling and man that’s a good way to get hurt.

So because all three types of gripping involve use of your fingers yes, most exercises do overlap a fair bit. Once the tendons for your crush grip start getting fatigued, the hand automatically falls back on the support grip - hence the name. So if you focus on developing a strong crush grip, you won’t have a weak pinch/support, they’ll also improve to an extent. Stronger forearms = better grip.

Plus gym equipment is made for crush/support gripping anyway, so most people don’t need to train grip types. That’s mostly useful to those who do stuff that relies on unpredictable gripping, like parkour or rock climbing.",0

20739,"Grip strength is split into three types, crush, support and pinch. Crush grip is the one you’d be concerned with most when I comes to lifting, and it comes more from the forearms than the wrists themselves.

A couple good exercises for the gym are wrist raises (regular and reverse), and farmer carries - I prefer to do them holding dumbbells by the plate instead of the grip. A 60 second DB farmer carry should have your forearms burning by the end. But you can look up grip and forearm exercises, there are quite a few.

Other lifts that require grip strength like pull-ups or deadlifts (no straps, obviously) are also great for building grip strength - but are also quite reliant on it. Compound lifts like these should be your priority anyway, and if you’re on a bulk, then targeting forearms with a couple extra isolation exercises twice a week should build up your grip strength nicely.

At home you can use those hand grip strengthener things, just get one with adjustable levels of resistance and use it consistently.

20797,i find rolling best for stretching as it loosens me up and releases the tension... as far as outdoor workout in the field I would much rather do crawling as it will activate more parts of the body and is much more tiresome then rolling,0
20798,"Ah in that case jogging/running, yoga, bodyweight exercises, etc. Pretty much cardio and light weights with high reps. This will maintain muscle without making them bigger and burn calories.

If you do enough cardio your body goes into a catabolic state and will breakdown fat and muscle to fuel itself (think about how skinny long distance runners are). This will achieve what you want but be aware this process happens throughout your whole body. Would be best to hover in and out of catabolic until your goal is achieved so its not so extreme.",0

20847,Progress IS perfection!! I say YES! Start out with just 7 min workouts. The goal shouldn’t be to obtain anything but learning your body and strength during this time. Learn to enjoy that feeling while you’re moving your body and feel the energy and strength that exercise gives you. You only need 7 minutes to start to get used to and seek out that feeling! Over time you can increase your time because you enjoy it and you want to do more! Do not force yourself to do a time or activity you do not like because you will not succeed. Just follow the good feelings and starting small should help you get there,0

right after each set of pushups plank for as long as you can until you buildup to 2 minute plank.

And being a part of the weight bearing part of the body it can be a real challenge. But I would recommend when you do anything with calf raises do it with a rep range between 20-25. High I know but it will assists with lean muscle development. Also jump roping is a good technique,0

You mentioned swimming? You should encourage her to swim. Maybe you can both go to the area where you have a swimming pool and something you can do and meet afterwards. Swimming is a full body workout. Also there is aqua aerobics and Zumba Aqua that she might like. Most women who take aqua aerobics are on the bigger size and you are in the water so no one can see your body.

Zumba which I don’t know if you two know anything about, but I used to teach it. There is Aqua Zumba but also the regular Zumba and Zumba Gold which is for seniors or anyone who is new to or returning to working out. Let me tell you, most women who do Zumba are on the larger size. In fact there are thousand women and men who started Zumba when they were 200+ pounds and loved it and lost the weight and went onto to teach it. They get the “Zumba bug”. It is easy to do latin style movements. Maybe you can suggest that to her. If you go to Zumba website you can see classes in your area. Zumba is not only in gyms, it’s in churches and all over.

I understand her anxiety and depression. I come from a home of toxic parents and it took me many years to rid myself of the anxiety and depression that resulted. I hope she exercises because it will push the anxiety and depression away.

20929,"First, I want to say that writing publicly is a great step!

My thoughts come as someone who is still thin, but has made significant gains from my lowest weight. 95 lbs to 154 over 3 years.

1. Calorie counting changed my life: The main tip to gaining weight is making sure you consume more calories than you expend. When I was trying to exercise and eat healthily to gain weight, I later realized I was only eating chicken breast and veggies and those calories aren’t enough to maintain MY BODY as it should have been so I made modest gains. When I started to use these numbers I made significant improvements.

2. If you can, I recommend having someone in your close circle keep you accountable. Either by attending the gym or checking in on your meal prep or accomplishments with you.

3. i recommend making a daily tracker of food and or exercise. Making lists can be a good reminder of what’s necessary to accomplish our goals and break them down so they’re not so scary.

4. If you have resources, consider seeing a therapist. It may not be necessary for you, but for me I realzied that much of my lack of eating was related to ARFID (avoidant and resteictive food intake disorder) stemming from childhood trauma, and the process of eating significantly more was more emotional than I anticipated.

5. Perhaps consider slowing down on exercise until you gain a small bit of weight as to be careful / consider reachjng out to a physician.",0

Question!: What do you do in order to keep the pounds just melting away? My fiance is about 260 and her lowest was 215 back in the summer, she gained it all back on the behest of her personal trainer (saying she needed to eat more to repair her metabolism) but regaining all she lost has upset her. Since then she's had a hard time getting it off. She lost the weight initially doing a low cal, strict keto (&lt;20g) diet but her trainer says she needs more carbs now that she's training with him so we stopped doing keto.

I guess what I'm getting at is, besides that she is eating more (though her trainer has been reducing her intake over time) what else could she do to help melt the weight away?",0
20937,"We've had a few heart-to-hearts about it. Hell, two years back we almost separated because of it. I'm afraid that she does what she does now only to make me happy, but as you said I need her to want to do it for herself. It's mostly a battle against depression I believe, she knows the factual reasons why she needs to exercise, not just eating healthy, but when it can take weeks or months before the benefits are shown it can be discouraging for a person that Doesn't have that handicap working against them.  


I need to figure out what her motivation is, and leverage it gently. When she was losing weight with Keto she was excited and we were out biking and walking a bunch (it was around summer time) but the progress we made went to shit when she started training with my friend who wanted to fix her metabolism. She's doubly defeated now, having gained all the weight back in half the time it took to lose, and she's busting her butt with the walks and training which feels like it's all for nothing, so why add more discomfort onto it. 

I heard on a video I watched the other day that I need to try to get her to focus on some micro goals. Instead of saying ""Your healthy weight is 120 pounds away I need to ask her ""Do you think you can lose one pound this week? Can you burn off two pounds this week?"" and so on, until we find that limit on what she thinks she can handle. Rinse and repeat: 2lb this week, 2 the next, and the next, and a year from now she would almost be there! So, if I could combine some perspective to her training (the 'why') as well as get her to sharpen her focus on the smaller details and less the bigger ones, maybe that would help to get her moving when depression says that's too hard.",0
20938,"Funny enough I asked her today what her favorite kind of physical activity was, and without hesitation she said swimming, our gym has an indoor pool so we will be going there to go swimming more often for sure! Unfortunately it's only a lap pool with a shallow end for kids, so it's not as fun as a community pool.  


I absolutely do love spending time with her, and she often is happy just to be in the same room together, which doesn't always workout because my office is seperate from the living room and i'm more of a PC guy than console. I digress, I was trying to make the point that I think the way you framed it ""lets go spend some time together doing 'X' "" (swimming in this case) might be the phrase I'm looking for to get her moving!

Dance lessons would be fun, I took Intro to Dance as a Culture elective and had a ton of fun with it, I'm afraid she would reject the idea due to the social nature of it, because of the other members of the group. One thing I always tell her, to try to get her to be less self-conscious about everything, is that she only needs to care about one and a half opinion's in this world, her own and maybe consider mine. (In relation to things like 'what if other people laugh/make fun/judge me)

Anyway, really like the way you put that, I'm excited to try this out on friday. (Thursday is one of her training days and I've worked out with my friend before. I'm decently fit and if I tell him to destroy me he will have me heaving with just a couple of minutes of dynamic exercises so I'm not gonna ask her to burn any extra energy lol.",0

Make it less about exercising and more about a fun activity you can do together.  Think about things like hikes, kayaking, skating.  It is physical activity, but instead of focusing on energy expenditure, just focus on enjoying yourselves.  

There is a huge difference between the messages : ""I want you to change"", vs ""I want to spend time with you"".",0

20943,"Honestly I was in a similar situation to your fiancé a couple of years back. I knew I was big and I knew I had to make a change but I didn’t care at the time. I had several people try and reach out / offer advice but it just went in one ear and out the other, you don’t really change until you personally decide it’s time. I wasn’t able to start making changes until it started affecting my health. Im honestly not sure how you can convince someone to exercise more or be healthier if they don’t want to but maybe just talking to her and having an honest heart to heart. Don’t scold her or belittle her actions just explain your fears and concerns and maybe she will understand why it’s so important she starts taking care of herself. Not sure if this will help but best of luck to both of you!",0

Here’s a video done by actual physical therapists that may help you: https://youtu.be/rLdz7CXbijo

I’ve used many of their videos and they have good suggestions for modifcations for most things. They have several speficially for hamstrings. If these stretches are still too much, just don’t go as far or decrease the angle by using something lower to rest your foot on.

I hope this helps and good luck!",0
20948,"I use a lot of free weights! I find that it builds more holistically for muscles on the core! Look at videos and try them out at the gym, or even ask people around you to make sure your position looks good. Try to do a lot of compound exercises with kettlebells and such. Use light weights to start so that you can make sure your position is safe, then lift heavy to build solid muscle! 

When I was first starting to lift, I was nervous about the position because I was scared of becoming one of those viral videos hahaha so I spent a lot of time at home just even practicing the movements without weights!

My first college year I exercised consistently but did little to NO CARDIO. I came home that summer after my first year and was told I had high blood pressure, almost pre-diabetic. While I was not paying attention to how much I was eating and not doing cardio I saw my strength increase but it wasn’t helping my health. The following year with more knowledge and research I was doing cardio 5 times a week while lifting for 4 times a week. And eating more healthy and Whole Foods (no processed/take out food)This method worked great for 2 years dropping around 35ish pounds over two years then this past year I have increased intensity and weightlifting resulting in another 15lbs lost. Current sitting around 200-205.",0
20966,Dam good read. I’d like to know about your progress as someone who has exercised for 4 years consistently.,0
20967,"Props to you for trying to stick to a plan. It’s never easy to start or hang on to a plan. But you have already made it past the toughest part which is starting so awesome job. 
I would focus on what’s going on outside of exercise and check those factors. Like what are you eating? Are those foods assisting in your daily living as well as exercise? Is your job to physically strenuous for intense exercise? Or you may be jumping into to intense of exercise before your body is ready for it. Maybe just some light yoga or daily walks/runs with stretching could be all you need to start. 
Typically when one day of exercise hinders daily living and exercise the next day it typically falls on sleep/recovery and how you are fueling your body.",0

In my early 30’s I feel like eating well is more important than regular exercise to maintain the mental and physical things you mention. I’m always doing light cardio and stretching, But that being said I feel like it’s also a good idea to take a couple weeks off from strength workouts now-and-then to let your body fully recover. Not sure of the exact science behind it, but I always feel more capable returning to an activity after a rest of a week or two.",0

20977,"This is awesome, I’m so happy the post was able to help you recognize something. I absolutely agree, bloating is uncomfortable and can be embarrassing for us, even If it’s not physically noticeable. When we exercise and eat correctly it’s fueling and replenishing our bodies, to continue to do amazing things with our bodies. I look at bloating as my body telling me something is out of funk and that I need to switch something up! When we take the time to listen to our bodies it will always pay off!",0
20978,"I'm so glad I came across your post. I'm sorry about what you're going through and hope you recover fast and soon. I've been trying to figure out why I've been bloating so much these past 6 months. I was so desperate i was willing to get meds for SIBO to help with the bloating (I'm the type of person who hates meds and prefers natural stuff and only goes to meds as a last resort). I rarely ever exercise and it's because last year I lost 15 pounds from legit doing nothing and this happened out of nowhere. I also have q flexible body and can gain and lose weight really easily so I know if I just watch what I eat I can stay slim and keep the weight loss. That's what I've been doing and once in a while if I know I'm close to gaining too mu ch weight I'll just swim a half mile and the next day I'm down 5-8 pounds and I know I'm good. Anyway, in the past 6 months I exercised (like cardio not just crunches which did nothing to help with my bloating) maybe 20-30 days max). I know I'm lazy and i saw another post about this woman asking why she was bloated and I asked her if she exercised and she replied saying she pole dances 3 days a week. I didnt want to comment that her bloating could be because if that because I only came across 1 we bite and 1 youtube video that lack of proper exercise causes bloating, but n ed vera across a person who actually experienced it. Anyways now I know why the people in my class who exercise more rarely ever get bloated and I get bloated so much. I got to the point when even when I barely ate anything, only a few croissants and ice cream, at the end of the day I bloated and looked 6 months pregnant. Thank you for sharing your experience I've been looking for a post like this recently, I dont know if you know how much this helped me. Bloating is so embarrassing and after a while it started hurting. Anyways thank you again.",0

When I was recovering from eating disorders (and even today because I always have to be aware), I focused on nutrient rich foods. Whole fat dairy (if that’s an option for you), chicken thighs over breasts (with the skin on, if you can handle that), etc. If there is a diet or low fat option, choose the opposite, at least for a little while. With one exception: if a side salad was the option, I went with that a lot because the fiber seriously helps after so few calories for so long.

OP, as a 27 year old woman with ADHD and in ED recovery, I know that what you’re doing right now is not easy. Try to limit your exercise and increase the quality and quantity of your calories. You’re going to get there.",0

Walking gives you a better posture, strengthens your legs, clears your mind, makes you happier, increases blood flow, relaxes you, great for after work to release stress. Some runners might not think it’s intense enough, and in fact it isn’t an intense exercise and it’s not supposed to be. Not every exercise is intense. Yoga is exercise, it can be mild or intense, same with moving your legs. If you are moving those legs, you are exercising! Walking is the most natural way we can exercise. You can overdo running, but you can’t overdo walking, unless you just walked all day without eating, that would be unhealthy. You could walk for hours and hours each day especially for people who can’t run and direly need to lose weight, it’s the perfect exercise and just optimizes your body.",0

20994,"Okay so you need to eat more food to put it simply xD. Which I am sure you know ahaha. When I first started recovery from my eating disorder I had no idea when I was hungry or not because I had ignored my body for so long. So n1 I would suggest setting up times for meals and snacks each day and make yourself eat them. 

Honestly on the no of calories you are eating right now exercising is dangerous and you need to ask if you are really 'after eating disorder' if you are regularly eating under 1000 cals a day and sometimes working out over 2hrs a day. It sounds alot more like you still have an eating disorder. You need to face this head on before you can recover, don't kid yourself into thinking everything is fine because you are eating a bit more.

You are going to continue losing significant weight doing daily exercise even if you up what you eat quite considerably - though your slow metabolism may make that not as high a threshold as it is for others.  You need to likely be eating nearer to 2000cal a day. You can do that healthily but really keep in mind that you should eat a variety of foods including a healthy amount of carbs, proteins and fats. 

Also rest days. To build muscle your body needs time to rest to build that muscle. That means not doing it every day but taking a break. Something like every other day or even just taking 1-2 days off a week. 

Anyway, honestly to me this post is concerning. Your calorie amounts are very low for a sedentary person, let alone someone working out every day.  Look after yourself and dont let the demon in your brain win.",0

HIIT is High Intensity Interval Training, basically normal walking pace for 2 minutes and then walk as fast as you can for 30 seconds. Take it back down for 2 minutes, then go again. Don't break into a jog or a trot, keep it walking, just walk as fast as you can for those 30 seconds.

I have been doing it in sub zero late Fall/early Winter and by the halfway point of my walk, I often need to take off my jacket, gloves and hat to dump some heat and not sweat too much. Going up an incline and pushing hard leaves me gasping for breath sometimes.

Do not do push-ups from your knees. It's too easy to default to a bad position by sticking your butt out.

But that's my opinion, I don't go around telling people: hey, don't get a lipo or else you are cheating/you are a fraud, etc, etc. Everybody has its own way and that's fair.
 And responding to the post there's no exercise that focuses specific fatty spots, it's your overall body fat percentage and the kind of food you eat. If you already cutted artificial sugar, take down a notch your fruit intake. I'm not saying don't eat fruit, just eat less and see how your body responds.

21079,Unfortunately there is no way to exercise for spot reduction. You just have to reduce your overall body fat % until your body decides to lose it from your tummy.

21091,"The fact of the matter is that the body is designed to move, a great many studies have shown that a sedentary lifestyle creates a much higher risk for injury later in life due to lack of muscular development to support one's joints, reduction in bone density, and a host of other issues.

Comparing the average person who works out to an ex pro basketball or football player is kinda like comparing someone on an average salary to a billionaire, the gap is insurmountable huge in the experiences between the 2. Pro athletes train specific to their sport and are subject to a ton of physical contact that the average person just doesn't see. For example, an NBA player playing 4 games a week, plus practice, plus specific physical training is a ton more taxing than the average active person's workout schedule which typically includes 2-3 days in the gym lifting and an additional 2-4 days doing cardio and/or other physical activities.

In other words, for the average person working out vs the average sedentary person, the former is going to have a much better quality of life in their later years as well as live longer.",0

21097,"Overuse injuries are definitely a real thing, but you're correct in using the term ""a lot of exercise"". For the average person, it would require intense training with inadequate rest, and/or improper form as previously mentioned. If you do not get an adequate amount of physical activity, this is actually worse becuse your bones will adapt, losing strength and thickness, because they are not put being put under their desired amount of stress/strain. As you exercise (an appropriate amount, with adequate loading and rest) your bones and back will adapt to the stresses you put your body under. Hope this bit of info sheds some light on your question.",0
21098,"When starting on exercise, you are at a disadvantage being so tall. The good news is, if you take exercising seriously you are at an advantage for how much muscle you can put on. It's a life long journey. I always tell people to start with ""girl"" push ups. That's where you do push ups from your knees instead of your feet. For a lot of people that's a good starting point, but for some it's still too hard. To make a push up easier, you need to raise where your hands are placed compared to where your feet are placed (forget the knees for a minute it might be too awkward). And to make them harder you can raise where your feet are placed compared to where your hands are placed. A chair for instance, place your hands on the seat of a chair and step out from it, do push ups from that elevated position. The closer to the chair you are the easier it will be. You could also do the push ups on the stairs, place your feet on the stairs and then lay down on the stairs and put your hands on whatever stairs are closest to your shoulders. As that gets easier you could go lower on the stairs so your feet are at the bottom of the stairs and your hands are maybe 3 or 4 stairs up, then lower 1-2 stairs, until your off the stairs completely and doing a full push up on the floor.

You've identified the problem. Your core, so working on your core will help too. Sit ups, planks, bicycle kicks, leg raises.

With whatever exercise you do, engage your core, that means brace your stomach as if you were just about to be punched in the stomach.",0
21099,"As you get older there are some body issues you're going to have whether you exercise or not. My knees are bad so I stopped running and started swimming instead and have had no issues. I also find yoga really helpful (and more difficult than I initially thought). However, having exercised my entire life my problems are FAR FAR less than most people my age (55) who didn't. I've got friends who, already, need to use their hands to stand up from a chair and have to take Uber rather than walk six blocks up one of San Francisco's hills. The benefits of exercise FAR outweigh any possible negative effects.",0

21102,"Start with planks. You can do them against a wall or a bench so you’re at an incline and not 100% against gravity if on the floor is too hard right away. 

Once those improve you might have to back-track and do wall or bench pushups too before on the floor since you’ll be moving vs just holding the position.",0
21103,"Athletes are doing extremely repetitive movements with incredible frequency. If you implement an exercise program that utilizes all major muscle groups for balanced strengthening and include cardio for heart/respiratory health it's hard to go wrong.

21105,"You could exercise enough that you're burning off the extra calories you're taking in. This might also help with your boredom issue. Even just keep busy with something active that isn't higher intensity if you want. Take walks, then eventually walk faster. Get out of the house if you can and not close to your kitchen.

Don't keep snacks and stuff at home. I'll go right through anything here, so I never have it. I make myself walk or ride a bike to the store for a snack. Swap out low calorie options for the high calorie favorites (NOT prepackaged ""diet"" foods, those are crap. Go for the veggies). Learn to cook from scratch: takes longer to prepare so you build anticipation, and you control the ingredients.

And lastly consider cognitive behavioral therapy to learn about mindfulness. Consider a therapist, or learn meditation, or read books on the subject. Get in touch with yourself and your feelings and learn to recognize these are just feelings and desires and it's ok to acknowledge them and let them pass without acting on them.",0

21171,"Running and intermittent fasting!!

I too live in the Midwest and 3 years ago I was in a similar situation. 6’2 &amp; 200lbs with no muscle mass AT ALL. I wanted to cut weight then bulk up. I was more concerned with having a slim physique than getting muscle mass.

I picked up running. It’s a challenge, don’t let the snow/sleet/rain/cold phase you if it was easy everyone would do it. Besides a good run can be done in as little as 30 minutes. Surely you can tolerate being active and cold for 30 minutes. Layers are key. I use [this link to help me dress.](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20803133/what-to-wear/) 

In addition to running I have found intermittent fasting has great results. I eat from 12pm-8pm and pick healthier options. Opting for frozen cauliflower rice over frozen fried rice or noodles. I’d say I get anywhere between 1500-2000 calories in the 8 hour window.

Get a couch to 5k plan. I like Runkeeper personally. I went from over 200lbs to 160lbs by building up to running 25-30 miles a week. Currently working on hitting 1k miles by the end of 2019.

Get out and run, no matter how slow or how miserable you are, you’re kicking ass that no one else is and running laps around all the couch potatoes. 

DM me if you have any more Qs

::Edit::
I also smoked, started by cutting back from cigarettes to black and milds and limiting myself to things like just drives, or just when drinking/out. Then I went to vaping and controlling the nicotine levels. Never made it a hobby it was just a way for me to feed my nicotine need. I gradually lowered my nicotine levels to 0mg and have been at that. I use it as a stress crutch or something to do while I drive. 

Don’t let smoking or vaping become part of your identity. It makes it harder to quit when you may feel social pressure. When I got a new job I switched to vaping and only did it in my car or in the bathroom where no one could see. I also made the switch to vaping and drastic cuts in nicotine levels at times when I was sick. Cutting from 6mg to 3mg of nicotine when I had the flu and my vaping time was limited. 

Life is complicated. You’ve got to make calculated moves for long term results.",0
21172,"Nah, I have other apps specific for that but this timer is nice because you can add prep, rest, and work time while organizing multiple times for set activities you like to do.",0
21173,"Does it tell you what exercises to do,  or is it just a timer?",0
21174,"Hmm good point. My goal is to have a daily exercise to keep me fit and healthy. 
I'll be sure to mix it up a little. Thank you!",0
21175,"App called 30 Day Fitness Challenge, free!",0
21176,"Based on your activity, you do need carbs. They WILL fuel your exercise. Working out more than an hour daily will deplete your glycogen over time. If you’re swimming that much, I’d just clean up your diet. Try eating natural, less processed food 80% of the time and eat more vegetables and fruit.",0
21177,Yes it's one of the best apps to customize the way you want to use the timer. It's called timer plus. I don't know if it's in iOS though.,0
21178,If you quit smoking then you will easily be able to afford the gym,0
21179,"If you’re just shooting for the calorie burn, then like someone said above jumping rope is a great option. It’ll depend on your floors and if you have people below you. Another great option is circuits training with bodyweight exercises (pull-ups, pushups, squats, burpees, v-ups, Russian twists, ...). Pick a few and rotate 5-10 reps for a few rounds with rest as needed. You can also tailor circuits to your goals. If you want abs and a strong back, do pull-ups, v-ups, and Russian twists. Other great options could be a yoga or a workout class at a gym. Ultimately as long as you’re creative you can get a good workout",0
21180,"Well, yes this is a decent amount of work. What is your goal though? If it’s just general health, then I’d recommend some variation. Jumping jacks for 30 minutes everyday is going to be boring. You could do circuits with a few bodyweight exercises or do a different exercise every day",0
21181,"No reason you can't continue smoking and do some working out, especially at the age of 21.  Just go on youtube and search for videos with the words ""yoga"", ""pilates"", ""bodyweight"", etc.  All of these can be done inside with zero equipment.  It's cold outside is just a big excuse.",0

21187,"This is pretty normal. Normal healthy disease free lungs have more than enough capacity for exercise. However, the heart has a harder time keeping up with more and more demand on it and the heart is the thing that adapts to make someone better able to perform aerobic exercise. So I think you would be good with what you are doing.",0
21188,"Honestly - shovelling snow is a great way to get some physical activity in. (If done for 30 minutes, that will be meeting the guidelines for the day)",0
21189,"You only gain weight if you replace the smoking habit with eating. Also nicotine suppresses hunger that might also add to the effect. Replace it with coffee which has a similar effect and also suppresses hunger. 

It’s really easy to quit. Most people including myself have had an extremely easy time quitting at our last successful attempt. The moment I threw that last cig away I just knew that I was not going to be a smoker again. 

Do not use nicotine substitutes such as patches and gums and pills. The argument is that the tiny amount of nicotine they provide only serves to strengthen your cravings. Cold turkey is the way to go. 

And going to the gym helps tremendously.",0
21190,I quit after 13 years cold turkey and lost weight because I was able to exercise more. Do it!,0
21192,"You should start with weight lifting. Optimize building muscle first. You don't need a lot of space and you don't need to go outside. Just pick up some weights and lift. Compound lifts like bench press, squat, dead lift, overhead press should be your biggest focus. They are typically done with a barbell but can be done with dumbbells too, if you are limited by equipment. You could be quite strong by the summer. You can start adding cardio as the weather warms up.",0
21195,Do hiit exercises.. there are planty of them in youtube,0
21196,Jump Rope.,0
21198,"Kinda. You have push ups, bodyweight squats, crunches, dips, wall sits, planks to name a few. Lots of variations like spider man planks. Can fill suit cases, backpacks, and milk jugs with weight to increase difficulty. If you have a good spot to do yoga in front of tv or tablet or once you learn the moves just have the routine play over speakers. 

Experiment with intensity. Do the exercises slow for a better muscle burn or fast to elevate your heart rate.",0
21201,so it is possible..... wow,0
21203,Try to tilt your pelvis posteriorly and keep your core engaged during each rep. This might help you “feel it”more.,0

21212,"When I used to work retail I’d average around 30,000 a day, but I don’t think I’ve ever been over 40,000. I was like I’m the top 1% distance walked on the Samsung health app. You probably had an extra workload because of Black Friday, yeah?",0
21213,"It requires more stability to do push ups on your knuckles bc for one, a knuckle has a smaller surface area than a hand so more pressure, and two, you're turning your shoulder 90° degrees outward when you switch to knuckle push ups which strengthens shoulders and back.  It also strengthens your wrists and hands (fighters do these kinds of pushups) bc those small muscles in your hand and wrist now have to maintain a stable vertical position in order to push up off of the ground, where as doing them on your palms has your wrists flat to the ground.  Hope this helps.",0
21214,"Yep big warehouse with 8 hour shifts.
I usually have 3 big meals and 1 small meal when I work, otherwise I feel fatigued.. thank you😁",0
21215,I bet you power walk like no other walking around that much.,0
21216,Woha... it must be a huge warehouse /) are you thin person ? Do you eat more calories ? When I do a lot of walk-in I do about 10000 and my average is 6k a day. Well done sir !,0
21217,Way to improve the leg game,0
21218,For the first week or so it was rough on my feet and legs but I guess your body adapts to things like that pretty fast and now it’s just the norm😁,0
21219,"I honestly find this amusing haha. Just curious, does your legs hurt even if it's a daily routine?",0
21220,Listen to this guy,0
21221,"Definitely not just you. The feeing you get after training is motivating and makes you feel confident. Push-ups does, to some extent, help with straighten your back. Plus, you walk chest high and proud!",0
21222,"It does help with posture, if done properly. When doing push up, you work on different muscle groups, including the serratus anterior, which is a muscle that helps ""flush"" your scapulae against your thoracic cage. People with underactive SA can have scapular winging, resulting in a somewhat slouch posture. 

And it can boost confidence too. With those nicely pumped, round and well-shaped after push-ups, I tend to stand up straighter to show off those bad boys. Jk.",0
21223,K,0
21224,Alright thanks! I always turn the height up a bit when on the treadmill. You think the stair master is better for toning my thighs and butt better than the treadmill?,0
21225,"I’m really just tryna slim my legs down and fit neater in skinny jeans and clothes. I still wanna be healthier and feel better in my own body tho. :) you seem like a nice person but my sleep schedule is really messed up. Is 7pm to 5 good? I’m always tired when I wake up for school. I want to lose 5-10, to get smaller then after I do and I can lean up even more than be big and lean. I want to slim down a bit you know. I stress ate to be at 170lbs and I want to show that I am strong and I can beat silly things in life and just lose the weight again. It’s my goal.",0
21226,Thank you for opening my mind. But it feels as if I was born to try and better myself because I’m always looked down on. I’m really just tryna fit in some skinny jeans and look neater so I can seem more approachable. I just wanna got in but at the same time be healthier and feel better in my own body.,0
21228,That's mostly because you have a pump going. I like to do push ups in between sets of certain exercises or as a finisher after a workout.,0
21229,"Run!  Best way to shape and tone those legs and butt!  And definitely run hills!  Also, it’s best to take one or two recovery days every week.  Your muscles need to relax, believe it or not resting is just as important as working out because it’s an equal part of the total process required to build strength, endurance, and muscle.",0
21230,"On rest days you rest haha. 

Sleep is so important.

But honestly pal, would you rather lose 5-10 pounds in 4 weeks and then gain them back or would you rather lose 5-10 pounds over a longer time frame but forever because you’ve fixed the things that led you to gain them in the first place? Losing weight as a result of positively changing your lifestyle to one that’s healthy will be more permanent and healthy and fulfilling at the end of the day. 

Also why 5-10 pounds specifically? Is there a reason for picking that number? Also, you’re 15 - like I said you’re body is not done growing. Don’t play yourself.",0
21231,"Dude, just look up HIIT, more articles than what I can explain on a reddit post. 

Of course 90 minutes a day doesn’t feel like too much for you right now, but understand that won’t last forever. You need a rest day at least, but I suggest scaling back the time and increasing the intensity of the workout

HIIT IS CARDIO: it consists of explosive and challenging intensity that help increase muscle mass more so than steady state cardio. You can use the treadmill and other cardio machines for this, as well as your own body weight or weights in general

Personal trainers are only legally allowed to give exercise advice, not diet advice. You would have to see and talk to a nutritionist about this. However, what I can say is that generally good-for-YOU foods, moderation, and listening to hunger cues is a simple and effective way to lose weight. If you don’t get results from this, there may be something else going on.

Lastly, don’t become diet and exercise obsessive. You were not born on this world to only lose weight",0
21232,"Yeah I take pics but I’m not very photogenic. I was quite depressed and I also don’t really have friends anymore since I migrated so I never had anything in life to make me smile. I still don’t even smile to be honest. I just want to lose weight and feel better about myself like how i used to be, I used to weigh 200 pounds then I lost 40 last year. I put on 10lbs this year and I wanna get it off before the year is done. I’m quite determined.",0
21233,"I’m fine with the low cal tho I promise everyone downvoted me when I say this but I really am used to it, let me explain. I used to weigh 200+ calories when I first started boarding school, the food was trash, the place is incredibly huge 100 acres or so. So I got loads of calories out by walking around plus the calorie deficit because I usually ate once a day with a few snacks and I drank a frick ton of aloe Vera and water because I quit soda a looongg time ago and the juice I drank was real fruit juice(I lived in Jamaica at this time lots of healthy food choices everywhere I go). A year after I already lost 40lbs without exercise. I started stress eating after I migrated and it really messed up my diet and weight adding 10lbs to my progress. But I’m getting back into it and it’s really not that hard but cravings for sweet foods are real the biggest issues so if it really hard I’ll eat like a pocky or so but I haven’t done so as yet.",0
21234,"Keep going! I used a bike as well, put headphones on and cruise around all weekend. Less stress on knees. Keep going mate, take pics as well so you can see it happen as its gradual to keep you motivated.",0
21235,Hmm. I really need to fix my sleep schedule I’m gonna be real. It sucks. Thank you owl girl. I NEED THESE GAINS THO! but frl what would I do on a rest day? I’m really tryna grind as much as possible I wanna lose 5 pounds before the year is over or maybe 10,0
21236,Holy fuck I suck ass at push ups man. I can do like 4 or 5 without crashing and if I push myself hard enough I can do 10 then I’ll crash extra hard. I can run for an hour or more tho. That’s why I want do more cardio to rid my legs of fat. They are way stronger than my upper body but fortunately and unfortunately for me really is a lot of fat is stored in my butt and thighs and for a guy that’s not my main goal. A lot of loose fat too but it’s been getting tighter everyday. I just hope everything works out in the long run. I’m really putting in the work.,0
21237,"okay. you are a teenager. your body doesn’t work like an adult’s yet. you should NOT be on a 1200 cal diet. for teens you need somewhere around 2,500 cals for just maintaining and growth! 

Yes, your weight might be a concern but talking to your parents and a doctor and a dietician is a much better idea than whatever you’ve described here.

And can you explain to what “HIIT” even is, sorry I don’t even lift I just use 3 things in the gym, treadmill, the cardio machine that you use your legs and arms with and bicycle. So sorry if I don’t know what to do. I’m quite new to the gym I’ve been on and off with a bad diet earlier in the year but I’ve stocked to my calorie deficit and I’ve lost 2 pounds this week and I plan to lose more. Since you are a personal trainer can you give me even more time that’s will benefit me such as diet foods? I started eating a lot of meat like boiled eggs, and baked nuggets every now and then lol oh also tuna for protein. I try to eat way less sugars.",0
21241,Damn i wanted to lose it quick but I guess your right. These gains take time.,0
21242,"This sounds like a big old excuse to me. Don’t want to be too harsh but cut those excuses out and you’ll find the weight will go down easily. I’d recommend looking at Jeff Nippards YouTube channel for further gym plans. 

Also, fix your diet. Cardio alone will only do so much.",0
21243,Definitely. Is it possible to overdo weights at 15?,0

21247,"Well done for getting motivated for change, that’s really fab and first step to achieving your goals!!

One thing is though that if you do an hour and a calf of cardio everyday and keep pushing yourself (to keep that progressive overload going) and eat at a caloric deficit you’re going to feel like absolute pants. And when people feel rubbish they tend to stop being motivated.

Take it slow! Have rest days, work in some weight training, eat well (veggies, protein, fat - not too little!), hydrate, sleep (!!) and remember that at 15 your body is growing and developing and that’s more important that a bit of extra fat on your legs. You want to make having a healthy lifestyle your priority which is what will motivate you and keep you on track in the long run xx",0

21250,"Swap the long duration steady-state cardio for HIIT

Brisk 10-30 minute walk after every meal

Figure out if u have to lose weight

Excessive cardio will encourage your body to retain fat

This is because its seen as a a form of stress so the body produces pur stress hormone cortisol, which will lower testosterone &amp; negatively affect our overall hormone health which is extremely important for losing fat while gaining muscle",0
21251,"Omg I am surprised that no one else is caring that you are working out for 90 minutes a day! I am a personal trainer and I wanna help you understand a few things: 

1. There is such a thing as over exercising. Working out 90 min a day, with no rest day, for the next year will definitely be categorized as over exercising. If you continue to do this, you will not continue to see progress because your body doesn’t have enough time to recovery. Most likely you will either be injuries or your body will give you obvious signs that you need to slow it down! Please have a rest day or two. You don’t have to sit around all day, but just don’t do vigorous exercising.
2. You can make these workouts more efficient with High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) 1-2x/week. There are so many articles on this, so please look it up. But basically, it reigns over steady state cardio because your body will need to expend more calories due to the oxygen depletion you put your body through. So less time, more work, and more caloric burn over time! You also gain more muscle mass in this tying of training than steady state cardio 


Please do not over do it! You WILL regret it later. Work smarter, not harder",0
21252,Thankyou everyone for the advice,0
21253,"Awesome! Now it's all about making it a lifestyle. I didn't lose all those pounds overnight, it took me probably 18 months to lose the first 55lbs and I've been lifting for about a year (going HARD the past couple months) and lost 10lbs over that year. So we're talking 2.5 years of hard work and completely changing my mind-set. You're so young though you'll be able to do it quicker, just don't expect to reach your goals in a few weeks or months or you will lose hope.",0

21258,"You can't spot target fat, where your body stores fat is predominantly genetic. Your body stores more fat on your thighs and butt (which is actually lucky because the really dangerous fat is stored in your midsection). All you can do is focus on a decrease in overall body fat. Cardio helps but mainly you want to make sure to stick to a calorie deficit. Someone already suggested MyFitnessPal and seriously you need to try it. It was a real eye opener for me and helped me lose about 55lbs. Once I had my weight under control though, I was ""skinny fat"" and started weight lifting to create the actual shape that I want. Since weight lifting I've lost a crazy amount of inches and only lost another 10lbs. Muscle burns more calories at a resting state so the more muscle you have the more calories they need to function so the muscles essentially eat at your fat. When you're building muscle though you can't be on a calorie deficit because they need fuel to be able to repair. It's such a balancing game. So fun.",0

Have you seen a person who is 15% body fat with a large muscle base vs one who had no muscle? Its a dramatic difference. One is flabby and skinny and one is aesthetic.

Your thighs look fat because you have too much body fat. Not because you have too much muscle. If i were you I would focus on building a muscular base. Its shown that weight training is more effective at losing fat (not weight). Add muscle and lose fat and you will look way better.",0

The resistance will help your legs too, just using them.  Find a cardio video on YouTube that uses 1 or 2 pound hand weights.  For a man 1 pound is probably too light though. The video will help you follow along to a routine set to music that will get your heart rate up.",0
21280,"Oof, that hard to have your body change unwittingly at the hands of something that is helping you.  So frustrating!  I hope the medications have helped your state of mind, I’ve been through similar experience and felt immense relief after they kicked in.  

I stand by statement though.  Accept and love your new body and booty.  Exercise because it feels good and don’t let cultural standards influence how you feel about it, as hard as that is, especially when it’s a change out of your control.  

Attempting to force change on your body bc you want something different from it just creates tension and dissatisfaction within yourself, imo.

I would suggest determining first if you want to lose fat, if you want to be more muscular (bigger muscles or just leaner), or if you jave any other goals in mind such as getting stronger or more endurance.. in terms of the number on the scale then diet is the most important, but this doesnt mean you’re in a better position physically. you’ll probably hear a lot about cardio for losing weight, but resistance exercise (lifting weights) can actually be equally, if not more, useful if you want to actually improve your body composition (fat &amp; muscle).",0

21301,"First, I just want to say congratulations for making the decision to improve your health and your life. I really want you to stick with it. You're young, and you are about to start building the habits that will carry over into adulthood. Make them good ones! Next, I want you to consider NOT looking at your weight for a while. As your body composition starts to change, weight can fluctuate in weird ways. Muscle is heavier than fat; water retention can affect weight, etc. Instead set a few performance oriented goals: like ""I want to go to the gym x number of times this week;"" ""I want to be able to bench press x weight;"" ""I will walk x miles every morning."" As long as you meet those goals, you are making progress even if the scale hasn't budged. Check out some of the workout programs in the wiki and see what lines up best for you. If you can get to the gym more often, I encourage you to. But ease into it. But even if you can't, I would say one of the first things is just to start going for a walk every day that you can. Start with that and see how it feels, and when you are ready you can bump it up to jogging. Regarding diet, it can be a pain for a complete beginner to make a meal plan, especially when you are probably not the one doing the grocery shopping. The MyFitnessPal app is super easy to use. You can just set your weight and goal, and then it will track your calories for you. You can just scan the barcode on labels. And it's free. Drink more water, eat less sugar. Do that for a month or two straight, then check your weight and also see how you feel. Good luck and stick with it!",0

It could also be that your glutes weren't activated. If you're not already doing glute activation exercises prior to your regular workout, definitely start incorporating them! My favorite is the crab walk with a hip circle right above my knees. It's a burner!

Remember to keep your glutes engaged during the hip thrust. If you want a bit more of a burn, but not ready to add more weight just yet, hold for 10 secs at the top of your thrust!

21318,"It's a little hard to know what is going on with your thrusters without seeing form.  It could be that your glutes arent firing correctly (not uncommon if you work a desk job), or it could be that your glutes are stronger than your quads, so they don't ""burn out"" as fast.

I like the feeling of glute bridges against the wall.  I lay on my back, soles of the feet against the wall, knees bent at 90 degrees.  Before you even lift, start squeezing your glutes, then lift off the floor.

Hamburners are also good.  It's like a glute bridge, but your feet are on a yoga ball.  Squeeze your glutes, lift your hips off the floor.  With your hips lifted, roll the ball out until your legs are extended, roll it back into your glute bridge, then lower your hips to the floor.

Deadlifts are good if you can properly hinge at your hips (look up YouTube for proper form).  

There are also small tweaks for lunges you can make them more glute dominant than quad dominant.  Here is a short video clip that shows the difference.

21354,"I understand your frustration and I myself was in some difficult situations in gym class and one point it another in my life. My best advice would be to practice. Of course consistent exercise and a strong diet would work great as you will build muscle and lose a bit of weight which would make things easier. I would also preface my advice with that this is only a quick boost to get you to get in shape and be able to do those exercise consistently as this will help you become healthier in life.

In the mean time and starting your initial progress, practice push ups and sit ups, I'd say atleast 20 full ones a day. Try your hardest and make sure your using proper tequnique. I know you said you cant do a single push up or that you can't do a full sit and reach, but keep trying and pushing yourself. Soon you'll be able to do one, then one to two and two to four, etc. Build your form and muscles up, while also starting a balanced diet to loose unneeded body fat and build muscles. Practice make perfect. I would say the same about running. Look up proper form and running technique. Then start using it and running everyday for 30 minutes to an hour. Try to get that time down as much as you can and build up speed and stamina. Again, proper exercise and diet will help this tremendously. If you are having trouble doing basic exercises and running, a new diet and exercise regiment is needed. I hope this helps and wish you the best of luck!!!!",0

1. Figure out the cause of your tailbone pain and treat that. See your doctor if necessary.
2. If your doctor clears you to exercise and do push-ups, make sure your core is engaged throughout the movement. Think about pulling your belly button to your spine and flexing your abdominal muscles. Lower back/pelvis pain during push-ups might be caused by poor core engagement.",0

21375,"Hi,

So reading these comments and a lot of them are completely misinformed. While it is true that diet is important, and always will be. You need to develop the underlying muscles as well. If the muscles are not well developed then even if you cut down your body fat% to 10% you will not have good looking abs as they simply aren't developed. 

TL;DR Just diet or just ab work doesn't work, they need to be done together. 

I am unsure how advanced you are with workouts so i'll just give progressions of ab workouts that might be useful.

Exercises to help with developing abs are:

plank -&gt; knee tuck -&gt; hanging knee tuck -&gt; hanging leg raise -&gt; hanging toes to bar

upper body superman hold -&gt; lower body superman hold -&gt; Superman hold

upper body hollow hold -&gt; plank -&gt; hollow hold - extended arms hollow hold

crunch -&gt; crunch with weight -&gt; sit-up -&gt; sit up with weight

In addition to this, a lot of your exercises will naturally engage your core, examples of this are bracing for squats/deadlifts. lunges, bench press ect so while core days are important, in most routines you will still be doing a certain amount of core work!",0
21376,also not full sit ups do crunches,0
21377,"If you starved yourself for a day or shit out the water weight like many fighters do, you will notice it goes away almost over night. However it will come right back as soon as you eat. Some fat is necessary, if you want to stay below 10% you have to work out 3-4 times a day and stick to a rigorously strict diet. It's better to try and work with your body weight and more cardio, but you have to keep it up or it will always come back so make sure it is an activity that you actually enjoy.",0

21397,"First off make sure to eat lots. Lots of cheap food in bulk.

Second keep up with the walks and gradually extend time until you can walk a reasonable distance. Then do the distance faster. At any point add a backpack with weight. 

Thirdly as you don't have access to a gym try to do bodyweight squats, pushup, planks, crunches. Fill 2 suit cases with books for weight and carry them around. Fill old milk jugs with water and you got a cheap dumbbell. That should give you a decent muscle base for when you get to the gym.

Fourthly is make sure to rest. If you do more pushups than you can handle you wont progress. Muscles grow when rested. When I first started putting on weight I over trained and had no clue why i wasn't progressing. A good way to progress is add one push up a day and when you fail go back to the beginning or close to.

If so, let me give you an alternative exercise you can start doing even with a sensitive lower back. 

Too much emphasis is placed on the barbell squat.  Yes, it is a great exercise but if your not looking to compete or really care about progressing with more and more weight on your back why do it?  

In fact, I haven’t programmed barbell squatting into my own program in over 5 years and I’m doing just fine!  The lateral lunge is a great way to challenge the ability to build strength, endurance and improve balance as you train one side of the body at a time. 

The lateral lunge takes a little getting used to and may require a little ankle mobility work but should be a staple in your weekly lower body training.",0
21440,"Hey! 

While Reddit has a ton of info on various topics, I would not look to it as a sole resource for relief. I don't know many coaches who focus on back pain and life after surgery than me but you can check out [Fitness4BackPain.com](https://Fitness4BackPain.com) for that specific topic or people like Dr. John Rusin for more of an overall general strength training aspect for all injuries and pain-free training.",0

21444,"I’m a uni student too!! 
Your hours sound about right for me aswell so definitely helpful Thankyou!! 
I think I need more than 7hrs sleep though.
The water thing is definitely a good idea! I have a bad habit of just sucking on my water bottle for ages when I’m in the relaxing phase before bed so I’ll try cutting that out and see if it helps :)",0

21446,"So right now, i’m a University student but i did an internship for a year. The hours i worked were from 9:00am to 6:00pm, prior to this i would hit the gym at around 10 in the evening but this wasn’t feasible when i started working, so i changed my routine... 

When i was working. I would hit the hay at around 11:00pm and get up for around 6:15am which gives me just little over 7 hours which for me is perfect. I got to the gym at 7am. 
I would meal prep every friday evening for the whole week. That saved me time in the evening which meant i could work on other stuff after work. 

It’s no easy feet getting up in the morning for me but one thing which helps me is having a gym partner because we hold each other accountable. 

I also try not to a lot of water before going to sleep, saves me from waking up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet 😩

Self-affirmations help me too. It gives me the drive to jump out of bed. 

It’ll take some getting used to at first, i was very sluggish when getting up in the morning but it soon became a habit, they say it takes “30 days to build a habit” 😉

Let me know how everything goes :)",0
21447,"My freezer is kinda small too and I dont freeze my food, just use the fridge and the food lasts just fine up to 3 or 4 days. Ofc it depends on some types of food but for the most part meat, carbs and veggies do just fine for a few days in the fridge.",0

21453,"Yeah that definitely sounds super nice! Empty cities have such a weird feeling but I love it. Hiking/bike riding sounds so nice too, you do that on top of your CrossFit ?

Oooh I love the ballet! How exciting. 

I’d personally struggle without eating when I got home but otherwise sounds like you have a really great lifestyle",0
21454,"No. I do all my things in the morning. Groceries, meal prep, answer emails and phone calls from home if I choose to. Hiking when it’s nice out, bike ride. It’s nice because most people are at work so you kinda have the whole city to yourself (65k size town/city). 

I go to work around 2:00pm, work and coach until 9:00pm. I work weekends too but I set my own schedule for that and take off when I need to.  We are closed 6 weeks out of the year so I usually do one international trip a year and usually 2 smaller trips.

I also recently joined our city’s ballet for the nutcracker this year and that practice is on Saturday. 

I don’t know. I’m still single, 38m, so I have a lot of freedom but owning a business is the highlight. I literally do what I love and get paid and create my own schedule and life. I’m not complaining.",0

21456,Good idea! I’ll take this on board Thankyou for your advice.,0
21457,"Difficult for me. I work until 9pm, sometimes 9:30. I immediately shower when I get home and go to bed hopefully in bed by 10pm. 

I wake up at 5:45am, make a coffee and piece of toast with PB and honey. Eat a banana on the way and take the coffee with me. 

Home by 7:45. Eat breakfast number two then office work. I own a sports facility (I don’t workout there, I joined CrossFit recently and love it so far). 

I work most days at 2:30pm. I like my schedule. I get a lot done.",0
21458,"Oh yeah that is still pretty early that’s alright then!

If you are worried about your quality of sleep I would look very seriously into how to improve that. For example if you struggle to turn your brain off at night I would look into meditation and other treatments for anxiety.",0

21463,Okay that’s a good idea! do you find the food lasts ok in the fridge? Or do you freeze it? My freezer is only fairly small.,0
21464,Wow how do you meal prep everything in that short time frame? I think that’s the part I’m struggling with just still doing stuff in the evening so it’s hard to make it into bed early.,0
21465,"Wow I don’t know how you manage to do all that without food!! 

Getting everything ready before bed is a good plan I’m going to start! Thanks.",0
21466,"Thankyou! yeah I thought switching to morning might help me out too for those reasons, just have to work out how to rearrange everything.",0
21467,"Cool Thankyou! Do you read or do any sort of entertainment thing? Or just chores and bed..

I don’t drink at all so I’m good there :)",0
21468,That’s great ! Thanks for trying my workout routine,0
21469,"8-9 is probably what I get now but yeah if I switch to the morning workouts it’s most likely going to be less. I don’t drink alcohol at all but I’d take high bets I’m kicking around in the first two stages of sleep. 

I’ve been going in the evenings but I’m finding it’s keeping me up later. I’m a slow to start up person but once I start up it’s really hard to slow down again so evening exercise just sort of keeps me excessively energetic for hours.  The offsetting makes sense though thanks! I’ll attempt to do that.",0
21470,"Yes as long as I dont slack and take my time doing those tasks. What helps though on a sunday night, I meal prep for the next 3 days so I dont have to worry about cooking after work. That usually helps with extra time.",0
21471,"Okay that’s a good plan Thankyou! 
I’m not sure what Benadryl is. 
Also I dont generally ever consume caffeine so I’ve got that one down! thanks for the advice I’ll give it a go.",0
21472,Ooh okay this sounds very similar to what I’m planning to attempt. When you get home at 6:15 do you find you have enough time to do dinner/cleaning/whatever else you do at night? Before going to bed.,0

I have my coffee maker set, lunch made, clothes in my gym back. All I have to do is brush my teeth, wash my face and get my work out clothes on, then out the door! Not gonna lie, I go to be early when I do this. 0830-9pm. Sometimes I’m up later, it hurts a little more to pull myself out of bed those mornings. 

Edit to add when I go to sleep,",0
21478,"For me it's a little different. I work flexible hours from home and will wake up around 4:30 to begin work before my son wakes up.

Once he's awake around 6:00ish, we do his morning routine. Depending on the day he either goes to school or to the kids daycare at the gym we go to when it opens at 8:30.

My husband works 3rd shift. So I put our kiddo to bed for about 7:30/8 and will relax until husband heads out for 10ish.

I find I don't need many hours of sleep. Maybe 6-7.

Good luck!",0

However I do love tracking how much I lift and how many times. Graph it, record weight daily and graph it. Its satisfying like a daily video game quest :)",0
21483,In bed by 9pm.  Wake up at 5am.  Do light stretching / yoga for 5-20 minutes depending on feel.  Then go into garage and workout until around 6am (again depending on feel).

I don’t eat before I teach but I am definitely caffeinated and it’s important to get all your clothes and items needed to get out the door done before you go to bed. 

It works out great and I find I have much more energy first thing than I do trying to teach/sub a class at 5:30 pm.",0
21487,"Sleep is a complicated thing. They say you should get 7-8 hours of sleep but if you have intense workouts you should have more like 8-9 hours of sleep. Also alcohol can affect your sleep, don't drink too much, or don't drink close to sleep, or don't drink at all. There are 4 stages of sleep - It's really important that you get deep sleep (for body) and REM sleep (for mind). You might be getting 8 hours but you might just be kicking around in the first 2 stages of sleep, which is worthless for recovery.  


I prefer to workout after work. Work is pretty draining, I find having a good workout brings me back to life which helps me enjoy the rest of my evening. I typically sleep from about 10-6. If I were to exercise in the morning I'd just offset that by a half hour. I'd just have a quick workout in the morning.",0

I feel great throughout the day and I get home around 6:15. I usually am tired by 9 to 10 pm and go to sleep fairly easy. Some times I hit the gym after work also. I usually drink a pre-workout before the gym because if I eat something I have to wait at least an hour and a half to perform in the gym without getting nauseous.",0

Sounds tough, but just lay in bed in the darkness at the desired time. Maybe even take a sleep aid (like Benadryl) if you want/can. After a few days I get in the hang of it, if nothing else the accumulated sleep deprivation might add up and helps sleepiness. Watch out for late day caffeine intake",0

I should note, I'm typically ""in bed"" between 9-9:30, but my wife and I typically watch a show before bed.",0
21499,Yeah true that makes sense then. It takes me about 1hr so I try to time for 9hrs. But thanks for your response! It’s good seeing how other people manage it for ideas.,0
21500,Immediately. 7-7.5 hours works for me and isn't too short of the recommended 8. I hit the gym 4 days a week so I sleep in on Weds and on the weekends.,0

Yum peanut butter! that’s a good idea to just have something small to start and a proper breakfast after I think that would help me. Thankyou!",0
21504,"Not original writer but I too follow a similar schedule. In bed by 830-9. I eat dinner usually around 5-530, hang out after. I’ve worked early shifts for so many years that I just learned to force myself into schedules I need/ want. If you want it you can do it. Helps to start on a weekend to begin a cycle

I eat half slice of toast with peanut butter about 60-90 minutes before I work out in the morning, as soon as I wake up with coffee. Then a real breakfast after workout. This gives me some fuel and a quiet time before my day starts really rolling. You may just need to experiment with what works for you. Like another poster said some days I fall off but I don’t beat myself up over it I’m human :) I work out at home (no $!) so I don’t have any travel time for the gym, but back when I used to go to one I had everything packed at the door the night before",0

21515,"Having a commitment to a class helps as well. For a gym I went to you had to cancel more than 24 hours ahead. Less than that you got charged $20. So I couldn't really wake up and change my mind. Get a friend to go with if you can. Otherwise once you go to the same classes for awhile you'll get to know people and it helps that they will be like ""where were you"" if you miss a class.",0
21516,"Yeah and they hold pretty well. Another thing I just thought about... When it comes to waking up early just set a goal to do it for a month. I've been an early gym goer for about 4-5 years now. Sometimes I just fall off and cannot get up for the life of me (winter or stress idk) but it's fine. You find another time to workout for a few months until you get back into the groove. Point is, yes push yourself but also if you fall off its okay.",0
21518,"Ooh that’s a great idea! Thankyou so much. I’ve been having overnight oats and making them the night before but 1# it’s too much food 2# I never have the time to eat it anyway, so having something like a mini quiche I could eat in the car is way better.",0
21519,Yeah. He makes mini quiches in a muffin pan for a few days so he can just microwave like 2 in the morning real fast. I think the prep before will really help so you can just wake up and be ready.,0

21521,I eat breakfast directly after. I feel the food sloshing around if I eat before. I guess it depends on the person. My husband can’t workout before eating. He feels nauseated halfway through his workout if he doesn't eat first.  So I guess you kind of have to see what works for you.,0
21522,"Bothhhhh

Nah but I understand! That’s around the wake up time I was thinking of when I said ‘8pm’ bedtime in my post so that makes sense. How do you get all your stuff done by 8:30 though? That’s what I’ve been struggling with most, I’m still eating dinner then. After cooking, eat, cleaning etc it’s so late.",0

21525,"I get up at 630 to workout and go to bed at night 10 every night. It takes some time to get into the rhythm and basically you’re going to be very tired the first few days. You have to reset your clock. Once you have at least one day where you wake up early, trust me you will fall asleep early. Just avoid any naps.

Focus on calories in and calories out in terms of food.  Cut out 500 calories a day, and pair it with exercise to HELP, exercise alone will not help you lose weight.  Its 90% diet.

Also, 500 to 900 calories deficit 3x a week wont do much of a difference.  That's less than 3500 calories (1 lb) and a 1 lb drop makes zero difference physically.  Give it a month or two to lose 5 to 15 lbs.  15 lbs will make a big difference.

A minimum of 1500 calorie deficit (judged by what you asked) will make a very, very, intrinsically small dent in a visible loss.  Instead, aim for a 500 calorie deficit everyday, and this number shouldn't be attained by exercise, it should be attained by cutting out food.",0

21640,"Good advice. The more water you drink, the more water your body is forced to flush out. Not only that, but the built up lactic acid in your body from exercising needs help to be excreted. Drinking plenty of water helps your kidneys deal with the metabolic wastes that build up from exercise and helps to preserve the health of your kidneys. 

As for training, strength (resistance) training is recommended 2-3 days a week with 48 hours of rest for major muscle groups. If you feel yourself starting to plateau (ex. progress slowing down) you need to increase the intensity of your cardio. You should be getting 3-5 days a week, 30-60 minutes a day, of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercises. Best way to get the right intensity is 50-70% of your maximum heart rate which is calculated using your resting heart rate. That can be easily monitored by your Fitbit. If you need help with that let me know your resting heart rate and keep working hard!",0

800 calorie deficit a day? Off your maintaining weight or being active and maintaining estimate? If off your active estimate: 1lbs of fat is 3500 calories so in 30 days you should have lost just shy of 7 lbs I think? 
Make sure you weight your self close to the same time every day after going bathroom. Gives you a consistent reading and should remove a variable in weight fluctuation (up to 5 lbs for me after a heavy cheat meal day).

It depends on the sport. 27 is still young for aport but it depends on what sport. Soccer, football? No way. It takes a long time to develop. Martial arts? Lots of examples of people starting in their late twenties.

Approaching it as an adventure for us rather than a favor she would do for me is a good idea. And definitely not focusing on losing weight. It's her journey and choice how she wants to go about losing weight, I don't want her to feel like I want the exercise to have that focus as well. I'll also make it about us having fun together that's not watching movies or doing groceries lol.

The more you guys work together and can communicate, the better a relationship will be. Having a partner is also a key way to stay motivated and active.

Explain to her that you really enjoy working out and that you would love to have her continue her journey by working out with you because you'd love to see her keep progressing and your already so proud of her. Focus on being proud of her because it sounds like you really are and people need to hear that more.

Explain how you want to be better and it would be great she can help you do that and that you'd love to have her work toward her goal as well. If she sounds responsive, find a program or a time that works for you both. Mabye work out at home, mabye make a time for the two of you to do it. Approach it as a new adventure that you two can do and have fun with that also has a positive side effect.

21675,"1st remember to warm up. Light jogging and lifting until you're warm. Safety is important as if you get injured you can't exercise as efficiently. 

Lift heavy. Compound lifts such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, push press to name a few. Pick no more than 1-2 per session. First few sessions lift light aim for 3 sets of 10 reps. Once you got the exercise form you can aim for less reps but heavier (say 3 sets of 5?)

Eat as much as you can. Maybe take some supplements such as creatine and a mass gainer protien powder. Cannot stress this enough. Carry a snack with you at all times.

Sleep and take days off. Listen to your body and try not to workout the same muscle groups 2 days in a row. Recovery is important as that's when all the gains happen.  

PM me if you have any questions. I'll try to get back to you. I went from 130 lbs end of high school to 200 lbs and now I'm a comfortable 175-180.",0
21676,"I'll take a look at trampoline, thank you! I didn't know it was there!

Thing that bothers me is they eat so little. I don't diet. But I also try to eat clean when I can! I don't want to over-exercise and eat clean for the most part :)

I've never heard of Tony Robbins, I will research him too, thank you!",0
21677,thank you!! i'll definitely have to watch some youtube and make some different lists of routines,0
21678,"1) Start small. The goal is to develop a habit this is permanent, and then add to it every so often. 

2) Strength training is better than cardio. While both are important, strength training is superior. 

3) Compound exercises are better than isolated ones. While all can be good, an overhead chest press is better than a bicep curl because it engages more than one muscle group. 

4) Squats are probably the best exercise you can do, but shouldn’t be the only one you do. It is important you do it with good form though. You need to load the weight into your flutes and not your knees. Start with air squats and work your way into dumbbell squats. 

5) YouTube is a great resource. The squats I mentioned above, watch videos on how to do them and what not to do. Same with other exercises. 

6) this advice applies the same if you are a woman. If you are a woman, you are not gonna get bulky like you see on TV unless you take steroids or testosterone shots like they do. 

7) Rotate between upper body days, cardio days, and lower body days. You need to rest the muscle groups that you worked out. If you don’t, you won’t get as much progress and you risk injury.",0

21682,"How old are you? That makes a difference. A couple suggestions. Increase your training runs. If you run 3 miles now, go up to five, without losing any speed. The second that some may disagree with is to wear ankle weights when training. A couple pounds each ankle. Don’t develop any bad habits and it will help your endurance. Carb up the night before your test. Good luck.",0
21683,"I’m just saying this because I feel like the answer is pretty obvious. I’m not an athlete. 

Tip: run faster.",0
21684,"identify your goal, plan load and reps around that. you can train for endurance, hypertrophy, strength, and power. also, there is a rule that if you can perform more repetitions than your count for 2 consecutive sets, you should be increasing your load. so say you're shoulder pressing 50 pounds for a set of 10. if you feel like you can press for more reps and that your muscle isnt reaching its threshhold, and you observe that two sets in a row, that would mean it's time to up your load. usually as you increase your load, you'll decrease the reps. this goes along with training for goals. below i listed each goal and the recommended load and reps as given by the NSCA (from which i received my certification).

endurance: 65-75% of max load for 10-25 reps 

hypertrophy (growth): 67-85% of max load for 6-12 reps

strength: 70-85% of max load for 6 or less reps

power: 30-70% of max load for 1-6 reps",0
21685,"I agree with this. Lift first, then cardio. And no, 40 minutes isn’t too long.",0
21686,"keep doing you. your friends dont know anything about exercise. cardio should go at the end of your workout. your 40 min cardio is probably working well to shed the weight consistently, but on those days where you feel like you really want to just get your workout over with, try higher intensity cardio in short bursts instead of long durations. sprints, plyos, etc. anything where your movements require quick bursts. 3 minutes of 100% high intensity effort on a cycle can give the same results as 30 minutes jogging on a treadmill. i take my clients through a ""finisher"" after each workout which usually consists of 3 sets of 30sec - 1 min of maximum effort on various pieces of equipment. today i had my military client do a rescue simulation where he went all out on the row machine for 30s, then went all out on the versaclimber for 20s immediately after, then sprinted around the track 2 times. this particular client also does long distance/duration cardio in his free time &amp; we have decreased his body fat percentage by 11% in a little over a month. not everybody will respond the same way. but keep doing what youre doing and only take exercise advice from people who have an education in that field.",0
21687,"What you are doing is just fine and actually a great routine. There is such a thing as too much, but that’s the crazies that do it for hours everyday. Give your self some rest days though. And I know people say cardio then lift. But I usually do weights then cardio. It has worked for me. 

Don’t forget to watch what you eat and have good portions!",0
21688,I used to do this. A PT picked up on this and saw me absolutely depleted when I then went onto do my lifting and he suggested I swap it around so I could lift heavier for longer without being so tired. I like it better this way tbh.,0
21689,Also try doing the cardio first as it acts as the warm up.,0
21690,"I think basic dieting and workout should do it. I wouldn’t do a ketone diet tho bc that will change the pH of your blood making it a little bit more acidic and I don’t know if that will mess with the hrt, and I’m not sure which hormones you’re getting.  Just know that’s if it’s testosterone it might work in your advantage but if it’s more androgens (estrogen or progesterone hormones, don’t quote me tho If these are androgens I’m still learning the vocabulary lol) it might work against you a little if you’re goal is to lose fat, BUT it doesn’t mean it’s prevent you from your goal. If you want a simple routine I would do like 20 minutes of cardio and then weight training afterwards. But other than that, I think cardio and weightlifting with the diet should do it",0
21691,"Make small changes. Start by just walking. PokemonGo helped me a lot in the beginning. Then light jogging. Use stairs when you can. When you go to the gym, you can do cardio for 15 minutes and the rest can be strengthening for 15. Overtime, you work harder and then longer gradually.

You can have blocks where you lift 2-5 reps very heavy, plus you will be working on maximal strength.  You can do blocks of training where you do 15-20 reps light weight and gain mass, plus work on muscular endurance.

Practical to buy new dumbbells every week or so or whenever I increase weight. That changed when I got my power blocks (which’s re amazing) but it started to confuse me about the reps vs weight.

When you can't do that anymore, you will need to increase reps (volume) until you can increase in strength, in a non-linear progression.

21725,"I would try and avoid any fad diets as they’re typically unsustainable long term. What’ll keep the weight off is doing something that is healthy and can be consistently maintained.

Losing weight is really just one thing: calories in vs calories out. You can increase the amount of calories expended by exercising and tracking meals (my fitness pal is a great place to start). 1 LB of fat is 3,500 calories, if you manage to create a caloric deficit of 500 calories a day, you’re set to lose 1 lb a week which is the recommended amount for healthy weight loss. However, as the other poster said, where you lose the fat is really just down to genetics.

I know you’re looking for a plan of action, so the general guidelines to improving fitness are:

-cardio at a moderately intense pace 3-5x a week

-resistance training all major muscle groups 2x a week

Think about how much time you have in a week and try to think about how you’ll create that caloric deficit of 500 calories. Just walking more and getting 10,000 steps a day puts you in the ‘active’ category and burns 500 kcals!

21796,"&gt;its just the amount of food.

This is a hard habit to break. **Don't expect to just will yourself into eating less.** You need to build new habits to replace the ones you have now.

If your problem is habitual, mindless snacking, find something else mindless to do with your hands to replace snacks, or make sure that you have healthy snacks, like celery and boiled eggs. I'm a big fan of boiled eggs in the shell, because the simple fact that the egg requires peeling to get to it means there's a little work and attention required, so I only go for it if I really feel the need to put something in my stomach, instead of mindlessly shoveling food into my face. And they're delicious with a little salt and some kind of sauce or mustard.

If your problem is meals that are just too big and caloric, try to replace calorie-dense food with stuff which is filling with fewer calories, serve yourself less at meals, and if time permits, eat slowly and only go for a second helping if you're still very hungry 15 minutes later.

A few years ago, I was over 260 lbs (118 kg) and lost about 40 lbs (18 kg), in the span of a few months mostly by replacing calorie-dense foods, like substituting home-made salads for fried cafeteria food. Part of this was that I always made sure to have a healthy snack supply in my lunch box so when I'd get the urge to snack, I could do i without going to the vending machine and buying a cinnamon roll or something. An important component for me was my cheat day. Friday was my day that I would just do all the old, bad habits. Fried chicken at the cafeteria, **beers** after work. If anything, the mindfulness that develops from the rest of the week makes the cheat day even more enjoyable.

And, ultimately, part of it for me was just accepting that I needed to be a bit hungry, at least at first. That part did just require willpower and distraction to overcome.

21806,"Its not the exercise that will helps you most, its proper diet. As a young person, you can exercise like many of us did-ride a bicycle, play sports, of any kind, like kick the can, four square, basketball, it doesnt have to be organized, walk to school and around your neighborhood.

Primarily though, limit sugar intake and sedentary living. Limit screen time, limit car rides to places you could walk and find a network of kids to do fun things with. Learn new hobbies/skills. When I was 14 I was riding my bike, playing tennis and doing tae kwon do. I went roller skating on Saturdays. 

Screen time leads to boredom which leads to snacking. Cut that out, cut out soda and just move more. Movement is life!

Idk if it’s related in any way.",0
21842,"Just some small extra tips. 

When overhead pressing and pressing in general keep your wrists straight and not like in the picture above. This is safer and you will have more power when keeping your wrists straight.
And if you want to minimize the chance for injury when doing lateral raise keep your thumbs above the horizontal line. This stops you from internally rotating your shoulder. The same goes for the bench dips, rotate your hands so your fingertips are pointed backwards. This externally rotates your shoulder and is a safer position for your shoulder.",0

If you Google"" HIIT yoga"" videos that come up are similar, but most are more like 15 min.

21844,"U need cardio and weightlifting:

For cardio, do 50 jumping jacks (like star jumps) and then stretch a bit and then do 2 mins of running on a spot at you fastest speed. Then spend 10 mins on running on a spot at a constant speed (but not your fastest). This will be your cardio sorted.

For legs I would stick to squats with weights, but make sure ur technique is done properly and that u don’t start with the heaviest dumbbell, for arms start with light bicep curls (maybe start with 2-3kg but do many of them) then do bicep curls with heavy dumbbells (maybe 5-7 kg first and do many sets but less repetitions) for abs maybe do Russian twists with a heavy dumbbell and do this many times.

Try to build muscle equally on all areas of ur body but also research dumbbell exercises.",0
21845,"If it is genuinely HIIT--30 second or so bursts of near maximal effort, with 1-2 minutes of recovery, then yes it should be literally exhausting.  That is, it should exhaust your Phosphagen and Anaerobic glycolysis energy systems, and then a fairly long repleshment period during recovery.

These are very different training modalities.  

* Yoga is a kind of resistance training--stronger bones, stronger connective tissues, increased neurological strength, increased muscle mass, and modest V02 adaptations.
* HIIT is metabolic training.  It leads to better V02 max through 1) cardiorespitory adaptions, 2) muscular capillarization, and 3) increased stroke volume (*more power per pump*), and 4) improved mitochondrial density (metabolic imrpovements).

They do different things and train different systems.",0
21846,Resistance training + calorie deficit. Combination of hypertrophy and strength,0

Once you can do 3 sets of 20 pushups,  you can move onto weights as it will be easier to perform with free weights after you have gained some strength in your arms.

21848,"If access to weights is an issue don't be afraid to get creative. 

You can do a lot with bodyweight exercises before hitting a plateau. Have an old tire? Flip it or hit it with a sledge hammer, or tie rope around it and drag it. Do dips using a bed or chair. Do regular pushups and when that gets easy put feet up or wear a heavy backpack. Use a playground near by if its typically empty.

Don't make the mistake I made and neglect hammer curls in favour of bicep curls.

Simply put, your body will not absorb carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are slow burning energy, this means u have to work harder to burn them which means u will have to  exercise more.

I know this might sound like taking this supplement is good, but over time (quite quickly actually) u will start to have deficiencies in sugars which cells require to function meaning you will be very tired. This will eventually put u of exercise.",0

21854,"Please copy paste, I am interested to know the details. I'm assuming it's an aerobic exercise. So I would say weight training is more important right now. Aerobic exercise is still important but I would maybe do aerobic 2 times a week and weight lifting like 3-4 times a week.",0
21855,"say i have a 22min workout plan (from nike training center app), how frequent should i do that? will it help if i copy paste the workout details here for you to infer?",0
21857,"I mean, you want to work biceps, do bicep curls, you want to work triceps, do tricep extensions. Keep it simple. Compound movements are going to be the best for overall strength and conditioning. You can follow all sorts of routines that say 5 sets of 5 reps, or some other number configuration, the reps are not super important. What is important is time under tension, and working until it burns. It's more important to do reps for a duration of say 25-40 seconds rather then counting out 5 or 10 reps. And it's also important that you work that muscle until it burns. That burning is acid build up and that acid is basically what sends the signal to repair and grow. No pain no gain. Mind you, if you are new, take it easy for the first couple of weeks.

If you really dedicate yourself to training and you are new to exercising you can gain muscle quite quickly (newbie gains). It's still an overall slow process so don't think you can ""fix"" yourself in a few weeks. I'm more interested in getting strong, so I look to power lifters for advice. If you are more interested in aesthetics then you need to look to body builders for advice. I think youtube is a good resource. Listen to the pros talk about their diet, routines, technique, etc. The more you watch the more you will understand and then you can piece it all together yourself.",0

21870,"As others mentioned focusing on lifting weights will be key. To lose fat you will need to be in a caloric deficit, so you’ll want to make sure you are eating less calories while keeping your protein high (for building muscle and recovery). From there you can manipulate carbs / fats however you prefer. Since you’re eating less calories you naturally will end up eating a low-moderate amount of carbs. Throw in a little bit of cardio (don’t need to go overboard) and you will see results!

Hamstrings were more locked on one side than the other because apparently I stand like a flamingo a lot when I dont pay attention (one foot down, other flat foot against ankle). Did it in front of my masseuse while paying and she laughed and said that is why I get that way. The massage itself is helpful for unlocking muscles,  masseuse is good for telling you specifically what to avoid and stretches to assist with problems in the future.

If you really dont want the massage, I normally hold the tight side an extra 10 seconds with normal stretching, as it feels more similar I switch to same time.",0
21876,"Stretch both sides the same amount, the tight side will catch up. 

If you are lifting weights lower the amount and try to lift facing a mirror to keep your body even. Focus on form as much as possible and take it slow. I recommend light compound exercises to keep things balanced. Squats,  deadlifts, bench, overhead press, etc.

A combination of High intensity interval training and Weights to start building muscle is the meta here. And if you don’t eat at somewhat of a caloric deficit, you won’t lost any weight, but you can still put on muscle if you hit your macros (specifically protein). Eat a diet full of micronutrients as well, as this is crucial in the repair of torn muscle fibers from working out (hypertrophy).",0

Also focus on a lot more protein in your diet. Getting toned requires a lot more calories than you would think. I would recommend following some fitness accounts on IG to try to understand what your workout needs. Sarah Bowmar has been so helpful for me. Also at some gyms, specifically planet fitness was my experience, will let you meet with a trainer for free where they build a workout plan for you to follow. Hope this helps some.

Also one last forearm tip I gained from Arnold: While doing your dumbbell curls, instead of starting with the back of your hands facing behind you, or away from the side of you, start with the back of your hands facing in front of you, so every curl is a twist up and a twist back down as well. 

Plus any compound back exercises like lat pull downs or rows, do a few reps with just holding with fingers and no palm. 

Forearms will start looking like a race horses hind legs",0
21942,"Yay! thank you, will do :)",0
21943,That’s like a wrist roller right? Do you think I can make it with a ten pound dumbbell and not the other type?,0
21944,"You're losing both lean body mass and fat. Without knowing what you're doing at the gym it's unlikely you're burning that many calories. You're calculating those totals without including activity outside of the gym. Either way, this is a pretty extreme weight loss meyhod, so I'd caution you to find something that will be a little more sustainable and healthy long term.",0
21945,"Get a broom handle size type of handle but make it 18” and drill a hole in the middle. Thread a small rope or paracord through it and make it like somewhere between 4-5 feet long. Tie 10 pounds to it, or whatever weight you want. Stand up on something, a box, a bench, a stair, and twist the weight up, then untwist the weight back down. 
Works the entirety of both forearms, burns like crazy and makes em swell up.

RemindMe! 1 year",0
21951,Check out Five Parks Yoga on YouTube. The vigorous vinyasa flows she does are amazing.,0
21952,I work for minimum wage and am in a lot of debt because of an auto accident. I have to save every penny. The way I see it if whatever sickness I get kills me it's just doing me a favor.,0
21953,"Yep, thx, I just tried the straight arm hang you mentioned and I feel quite sore in my forearm area so I really worked it! As for the farmers carry, in still growing so I can’t do them as it would stunt just growth. Thank you for your advice! 🙃",0
21954,I literally do 60 push ups a day and I have seen no difference in forearms size 😭😅,0
21955,Play tennis,0
21956,Push ups have helped me develop my forearms if u go hard at it,0
21957,"For me it's holding heavy stuff.For example heavy deadlifts or heavy shrugs or farmer's carry.Also chin ups or hanging on the bar, hammers curls, reverse curls... There's some specific training for forearms, I don't do that so can't really give you good advice.But my forearms are very sore after exercises I mentioned.",0

21968,I mean but in my case all my friends even called me out for having such skinny forearms,0
21969,"Easy.

Start bouldering. It's super fun and your forearms are gonna grow like whoa.

I'm a woman and touching my forearms after bouldering for a couple of months is like touching a dog's hind leg; it's pure muscle.",0

21981,"Thank you! Yeah I try to just walk around my room whilst I watch videos or listen to music, I guess I’m looking for something that might feel a little more like a work out",0
21982,"Continue with yoga. Do squats, push-ups, lunges, supine rows by hanging between two chairs. Pretty much any core exercise. If you want to increase stamina without leaving your flat, string your exercises together without any rest to get your heart rate up.",0
21983,"Yeah that sounds good, I’ve never done yoga as a means of exercise more for flexibility! Thanks :)",0
21984,Popsugar fitness on YouTube has a lot of great no equipment videos. Some of them have jumping but they usually have modifications where the jumps turn to steps or lunges or squats!,0
21985,Walk in circles and do squats,0
21986,Why not continue yoga? Or try some power yoga to build up internal heat and burn some extra calories.,0

21996,Eat (far) less.  Walk (far) more.,0
21997,GET OUT OF THE FLAT! go for a power walk or a run!!! Get out enjoying life. Loading and strengthening your joints and losing weight! Youll see the great outdoors too. Enjoy the endorphins exercise gives you man! Live your best life.,0
21998,"Hey what's up?

IMO I think passing the cscs first is a better choice. It's more of the solid foundation for the CSPS. Essentially the CSPS is more about how to program and perform assessments on special populations. The CSPS is much more in depth with special cases. There are probably about 50 special cases that the book discusses, from neurological (like MS, PARKINSON'S,) to adolescents and children, female athlete triad, dyslipidemia, hormone issues like hyperthyroidism, aging adults, autism, cancer,. . . 

I really enjoyed learning the material, it gives the summary of the condition, typical medications given to patients and their relative effect on exercise, how exercise will affect the patient, and how to program for their specific needs.  If a spot is in the future, I highly suggest the CSPS, if you're like me, you'll get a bunch of great information.",0
21999,Woah sick subreddit. Joined,0
22000,I do have a pull up bar at home! Will do.,0
22001,r/GripTraining,0
22002,Yea I completely believe you on that. I have done my research on creatine and that is why I’m avoiding it.,0
22003,"I'm new to this, so I can't give much advice outside of do tricep workouts like tricep push-ups and general full body workouts like push-ups and pullups. General calesthics stuff.",0
22004,"THANK, YOU GUYS",0
22005,Are you a guy? Some sort of hair loss is expected for guys. Also avoid creatine as I’ve experienced rapid hair loss only at 20 years old when I used to take it. It stopped now because I’m avoiding it. I know there are studies that say it doesn’t cause hair loss and some studies that say it does but this was my experience.,0
22006,"Man, this is how you let the ego go.",0
22007,Yep same exact thing happened to me.,0
22008,"Yay you! The perseverance to stick to it alone, is commendable.",0
22009,"Thanks for the insight. And currently at 1,200-1,600 per day. I do take a multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin C, Vitamin D3, and biotin pill everyday.",0
22010,"It’s probably a dietary issue or hormone issue. Get a blood panel done, and make sure all of your Thyroid hormones are checked. 

You can take a multivitamin, a B complex, vitamin D3, and fish oils and see if it helps. Make sure you haven’t eliminated any essential nutrients and that your protein/fat/carb macro nutrient goals are balanced, and definitely make sure you are eating *enough* calories. Your hair, and every other part of your body, is made from the food you eat. If you are lacking nutrients you are fucking yourself up. 

How many calories do you consume each day? What are your stats? What is your diet like?",0

22012,"If you do pushups on your fists, on some padding, then you won't have to bend that way.  As a woman in great shape, if you don't want to bulk up, but to still gain usable strength, use real light weights, and on your back.",0
22013,"Of course getting in better shape helps.  If they say strenuous exercise is alright; I'm not a doctor, so consult them, but shadow boxing brings fast benefits.  Jogging may not be good for you until you use it to get lighter first.  Even very skinny runners can feel the difference between the street, and the asphault on the body, at the end of runs, for example.  :0  [Shadow Boxing](https://youtu.be/6AvL2Y2SQEA)",0
22014,"I know hey, losing both and constant pain in my knees.",0
22015,"No, because it happens directly after exercise.. no other time, and has been going on for 3 years without any disturbances in pattern",0
22016,Honestly good video very insightful,0
22017,"I feel your pain. From experience, it’s obvious that doctors are just guessing. They don’t know a lot sometimes. Most of the recent research seems to suggest that losing weight and improving condition will help most palpitation episodes. 

Your mileage may vary, I’m not a doctor, consult your medical advisor before undertaking anything, I’m not responsible for any injury, etc.",0
22018,"10km is a bit overkill, only because youre also burning muscle along with fat after you run for a while.",0
22019,"Have you considered that it could be anxiety? If the doctors are saying there isn't anything ""physically wrong"".",0
22020,"Hello, not really a s&amp;c question. But I saw that you're also working on the NSCA  CSPS. I'm working on the CSCS now and was also quite interested in the CSPS (since there's a possibility that a DPT program in my future). I was wondering if you could elaborate on what type of material is covered in that cert? I couldn't really find anyone speaking about or any real in-depth info that's covered other than what the NSCA site states. Any information would be much appreciated.",0
22021,"Thanks for the comment and support appreciated! Tell me about it, only did 3k today, knees, feet, ankle couldn't handle it this morning. Has been in pain since day 2.",0
22023,"I'm working toward the same goal and the things that have been going pretty well for me have been a lot on running, body weight exercises (i.e. push-ups, sit-ups, squats), and putting in time with a heavy bag for muscle build up. It's definitely a challenge, though! Best of luck!",0
22024,"Srsly, let's fight.",0
22025,I tried doing this recently and realized a few weeks in that I needed to rest more often than the challenge allows. I ultimately toned it down significantly because my body couldn't recover properly. Make sure to include adequate rest days and good luck!,0
22026,"5am start this everyday, work, kids, edit video, I'll say probably 30 days. No pull ups, probably lift weights at home, starting to get bored.",0
22027,"Yes of course, then it wouldn't be a challenge, 30 days then I'll stop.",0
22028,"5am start this everyday, work, kids, edit video, getting shit from people, I'll say probably 30 days. No pull ups, probably lift weights at home, starting to get bored.",0
22030,"Is it weird to anyone else..the steep rise in difficulty when it comes to the running?

100  cal. pushups, situps and squats wont really do shit for you and isnt difficult for anyone reasonably fit but a 12 mile run is uuuh..takes effort",0
22031,6.2 miles a day will hurt. 6.2 miles a day and 3 sets of 100 rep exercises will definitely hurt.,0
22032,"TL:DR

 1. Be mindful in the exercise session  

2. Exercise develops a positive, progress mindset

22036,"Putting on lean muscle is a challenge but it is doable. High protein intake and be in a slight caloric surplus and weight train consistently, you’ll see results. Lean muscle is a slow process, but it’s worth it in the long run. 

Carbs and fats, you can do whatever you want with. As long as you’re not in a HUGE surplus, you won’t just stack on heaps of fat.",0
22037,Your body doesn’t hurt? When I run 10k I wait 2 or 3 days before going back bc I can feel in my back and knees,0

22058,"Im 22 and in a fraternity, definitely a challenge for me. Its not all that rare for me to drink 3-4 nights a week. Learn which drinks are “best nutritionally”. For example 3 beers generally will have a lot more calories than 3 vodka tonics. On the other hand, hard alcohol generally has more sugar in it and is more dehydrating... its a balancing act. And i know its cliche as fuck, but have a full glass of water between every couple of drinks. Not to pace yourself but it fills you up and leaves you not wanting to drink as much alcohol.",0

22068,"I can relate ....... but then I decided to fight the negative shit messages in my life, cut some ties with this  negative person/false friend and aspects of relationships with all in general in my life; decided their path had NOTHING to do with mine And I recommitted myself to Martial Arts and Music. This has been a fairly recent state of refocusing myself, but it has made alcohol really obsolete for me. Martial Arts schools are generally open every night and they make you really positive. You know that saying, “If you want peace, prepare for war.”  🤘🏼🌞",0
22069,"That's about how much I drink on a bad night (like tonight), but the amount I drink is generally a symptom/consequence of feeling like shit rather than the cause (ie if I don't end up mentally crashing then I won't drink) but I agree that I need healthier coping mechanisms.

22084,I think it might be your joint cracking. When I started working out and I'm doing rear delt flies I noticed my shoulder would pop out almost. I talked with my doctor about it and she said she thinks its just because my shoulder needs to build up strength so do a lower weight for that one and slowly work up.

22141,"When I started working out in the mornings, I had to make three changes:

1. Drink a good amount of water before and during the workouts. Everyone wakes up dehydrated but I don't really feel it unless I'm working out.
2. I had to make sure I was doing a proper full body warm up. If I don't, I feel like shit and am sore all day. My whole body is stiff when I wake up, so I do a 10-15 minute full body warm up (mostly dynamic stretches and mobility drills, maybe some lunges or knee raises, some walking if I'm running). I always do full body, but I focus more time on body parts I'll be using that work out. 
3. I have to eat right after. I usually don't wake up hungry, and if I have food in my stomach I usually feel like crud after a work out so I usually exercise fasted. But if I don't eat soon after, I get a little light headed and tired. I didn't really change how much I ate, just when I had the meals.

One thing about the sleep, it doesn't really matter how much sleep I get on that night. It matters more for me how much sleep I've been getting the last couple days. If I have a bad week and haven't slept much, even on a night I get 8 hours, I will feel terrible the next morning. If I have been getting enough sleep all week, but only get 6 hours one night, I will still feel pretty good. If I ever get less than 5 though, it's terrible regardless of how the rest of the week has been.

This is a pretty common question and if you have spent any time at a desk I am sure you have noticed a change in your posture over time. 

Slumped shoulders commonly known as rounded shoulders does not happen overnight. It's a process from our daily postural habits and lifestyle. Having rounded shoulders isn't going to kill you but it can be a factor in a lot of common aches and pains both in the shoulders and lower back 

What I want to do today is give you a few strengthening exercises that are interestingly not really talked about when it comes to strengthening the shoulder and upper posterior chain as a whole. 

These exercises don't require big bulky pieces of exercise equipment nor do you need to pay some provider gobs of money to watch you do them on yourself.

22167,"I was never a morning person until I started working out in the mornings. You didn't mention what exactly you're doing, but a few things to consider:

1. Sleep is so very important. If you often feel bad in the morning and often have nights as you described with several hours awake, not only is your morning workout going to be grueling, more than like your productively all day is impacted. You should speak with a doctor if you are having trouble sleeping, wake up frequently and have trouble getting back to sleep, or always feel unrested in the mornings.
2. "" I even ate a small breakfast and drank water prior to moving my body "" I can go with or without eating before morning workouts, but we as humans are dehydrated in the morning and this condition is worse if you're not getting enough water during the day. You need to drink 2 full glasses of water minimum prior to working out and at least 1 during/after to re-hydrate your body from the overnight fast. Additionally, depending on your caloric intake, a little breakfast may not be enough. I tend to eat a small meal before consisting of high protein cereal in yogurt and have a protein shake after as well as a more varied breakfast (breakfast sandwich, protein oats, eggs and bacon, etc). You need to not only break the fast but get some protein/calories in your system to help recover from your workout.
3. Working out in the morning requires a warmup to get your blood flowing even more so than later in the day. Jumping from sleep into intense exercise is a big shock to your system. The warmup doesn't have to be long, just enough to get your blood pumping and heart rate just slightly elevated.",0

22169,How soon after eating did you train? It usually takes a good 30min to get these nutrients into your body for you to see an impact.

22335,"## What is a good exercise to build strength in the upper back?

When it comes to correcting things like poor posture, rounded shoulders or an achy mid-back, we can’t always resort to smashing it with a foam roller or stretching. To be honest these things bring more of a mental relief than an actual structural long-term change.

##### So instead let’s take more of a strengthening approach.

If you’re looking to build a stronger upper back this exercise is a great way to do just that.

I call these the Shoulder Field Goals…I know, a super creative name but they are great for building better control, strengthening and increasing overall endurance in the posterior shoulder and upper back.

You can do them the way you see here in the video with no weight or add small amounts of weight as your strength increases. For more advanced lifters I have found using small barbell plates work the best for challenging this position.

## How much should I do?

A great start with this exercise would be to program these ahead of any major lifts. So doing 2-3 sets of 8-10 without weight is perfect.

If you want to use this as one of your primary exercises that’s totally fine as well. The rep and set scheme can stay the same and weight can be added for more difficulty.",0

Given you’re otherwise healthy, you should be able to maintain your weight if you keep those numbers in more or less a balance. If you adopt more of a sedentary lifestyle or won’t be able to exercise in any meaningful way out there, then you should create a caloric deficit by consuming less. If you choose to go that route, it would be best to consult with a licensed nutritionist. Best of luck",0

Also the amount of food and kind of food is very important to your growth, especially since you have only started, so you will see the biggest growth in the first few weeks. Make sure you also get plenty of sleep, so you body can repair itself. Your muscles will also be sore a day or so after which is a positive sign but make sure you stretch the day after the workout to ease the soreness because the second day tends to be the most sore.",0

22348,"- Workout on a different area on your body everyday. 
- You want to do compound movements to active multiple muscles. 

I focus on chest, legs, shoulders/triceps, and back on separate days. Unless you want to grow a specific area of your body, you can work on the muscle more than once a week, make sure you have a rest day.

This is a list of exercises that I do:

*Shoulders*
Upright row
Farmer carries
Battle ropes
Lateral raises (kettle bell)
Standing dumbbell press
Sitting dumbbell press
Military press
Sitting military press
Cable lateral raise

*Triceps*
Dips
Horizontal bar dips

Parallel plate raises

*Back*

*Triceps*
Dips
Horizontal bar dips
Push down
Medicine ball push ups
Skull crushers

*Legs*
Squats
Calf raises
Leg curl
Leg extensions
Lunges
Bench standing lunges

Try to do atleast 3+ sets for each exercises and rest in between sets and 6-8 reps for each set (this will change later on as you get more experience). 

There are a bunch videos on YouTube that cover form/technique (I personally follow; Alan thrall, Jeff nippard, omarisuf). 

Remember that form/technique is much more important than how many reps and weight you can do.

22399,"Hey boss, 20m with a skinny build too.  Good on you for making this life changing decision!  I can be able to give you some food tips for gaining weight, and feeding yourself with what your metabolism needs.  I would suggest meal prep, as it helps out with portion control, and so you can be able to maintain consistency with your diet.  What I normally do for food to bulk up (for 5 gym visits a week) is I take, 24 eggs, and onion, and a pound of 93/7% ground beef (and some spices and cheese to taste), and mix them all up together in a big pan.  For portion control, I use 700ml food storage containers, and set them aside for the week.  That is what I’ve been using for breakfast.  Now, for lunch, I take and make a concoction of cooked chicken, garbanzo beans, rice, and cheese, and mix those up together as a nice, high protein, high carb meal, which is important for you to gain weight.  As for dinner meals, I take and use this recipe from Natasha’s Kitchen [Recipe Link Here](https://natashaskitchen.com/beef-plov-beef-rice-pilaf-recipe/)   This recipe can be able to fill 1100ml containers between 1/2-2/3rds full, and is very filling, and it can be a great meal to eat before, or after working out!  I know bulking/gaining weight with a high metabolism is difficult, but I know you got this!  Just make sure to keep your daily caloric intake between 3-5k calories per day, and you should be onwards to success",0

22434,Great answer. Just thought I'd add for OP that while they do go away when you get used to the exercises- they will return if and when you take a break from them for a couple of weeks and start again. Man those DOMS can be brutal. Leg day + Stairs Afterward = Hell!,0
22435,It's really important to take it easy when just starting out. You want to get to the gym everyday and do relatively light work outs as opposed to straining yourself and not getting back to the gym for 2-3 days at a time.,0
22436,"After my first time at the personal trainer, I had to walk like a crab because one leg would only go forward and the other one would only go backwards. It got much better. After a few weeks I looked forward to whatever pain she wanted to inflict for the week.

Now I am starting over, not completely but I got away from strength training and gained the spare tire again. Taking it easy but also making sure I hurt a little bit each time I leave the gym",0
22437,More on the anxious side here.  I’m a hot mess if I don’t exercise at least every other day.,0
22438,"DOMS can last pretty long, it typically should be gone in that 72 hours as you stated but for some people it can last a little bit longer. Typically, for a lot of people it takes on between 24 and 48 hours after exercise and then subsides by that 72 hours. Again, however, a lot of individual differences exist so it is hard to predict exactly when.

Just a quick definiton for people who don't know what DOMS is it stands for Delayed Onset Muscle Fatigue, it typically happens when stressing your body in a novel way. It is the result of your bodies muscles have micro tearing, this later allows them to rebuild to be stronger.

To specifically answer your question, no you should not be feeling it everytime. The pain typically only happens when you just start exercising or when you start exercising with more intensity or different ways. Especially, if you are a novice exerciser this may happen a couple more exercise sessions (probably 2 max) when starting out but it should not take long for your body to get use to these exercises as long as you stay consistently on schedule. Again I want to stress that there can be significant individual difference but if you stay on schedule you will stop feeling the effects.",0
22440,Why did you use a o instead of a 0 tho. The world may never know.,0
22441,"I guess it depends on you. For me personally, I try to avoid working out at night unless if I don’t have time during the day then I’d try to squeeze in very short workout in the evening. The reason is because when I workout late, I won’t be able to sleep at night because after exercising I feel more energized and my brain stays alert. It’s always beneficial to workout early mornings or during the day if possible, then rest your body at night.",0
22443,Honestly. I would change the detergent to some hypo allergenic. You might've washed your gym clothes or they came into contact with something you're allergic to.

I think a good rule for the weights is that if you can do 3 sets of 12 reps, it’s time to increase the weight. It should be a challenge around 3 sets of 6-10. But yeah, try to exercise other muscle groups too. Curls only actually tackle a really small part of the puzzle.",0

22456,"If you go to the gym from 10 to 11, you will need to eat something afterwards. Then you need to wait at least 2 hours before bed, otherwise if you constantly eat and go to bed right away you will end up with acid reflux and have a hard time sleeping.

22457,Ignore your time away. Tell your running self that it's a RECOVERY run. NO METRICS. Just a logged run.,0
22458,"There are other factors to consider:

1. How much sleep do you get every night? 
2. Are you hydrating appropriately EVERY day? 
3. How often do you exercise?
4. What kind of food do you eat? 

If you don't at least get 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night, that might affect your energy levels. Also not hydrating well.. you know that affects you as well. Exercising at least 3 days a week is pretty optimal. And of course your diet, if you eat processed food and candy/chips, this will kill your metabolism and energy. Its also fucks with your libido to an extent of repeated junk food consumption over a long time.",0

22466,"I second this. You will be finding time/sacrificing sleep to do it either late or early. Most people I know do it first thing in the morning and ride the endorphin/energy wave for the rest of the day. I know a few people who work out late and they admit that it negatively impacts their sleep. That being said, the best time is whatever time works best for YOU and the one YOU will do consistently. Good luck and stick with it.",0
22467,"Have a look at YouTube channels like Whitney Simmons. She does loads of videos on training and eating which you might find helpful. She has a really amazing attitude towards life as well. 

As for the actual workout structure, try doing between 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps (maybe higher if not using weights) of around 5-8 exercises. I’d also suggest splitting your workout sessions into upper (biceps, triceps, shoulders, back, and chest) and lower (quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calf’s) on different days and then I’d finish with core at the end of each workout. 

I work in a gym and this is what we typically suggest to people just starting out :)",0
22468,"For getting started, I liked yoga. A good teacher will tell you how to modify the routine to suit your experience. I didn't work out regularly until I was 18. My yoga class accepted me for where I was. Yoga and rollerblading changed my life because I enjoyed them and therefore stuck with it.

There is an app called BodBot that I use for weight lifting. It creates a routine for me automatically based on my time, goals and equipment, and it shows gifs for every exercise.  I don't think it's a perfect app, but it gets me to try a lot of new exercises, and I have a few new favorites. :) I generally tell the app I want to work out for 15 minutes longer than I actually will so I can delete exercises I don't want to do from my routine without feeling guilty.

22482,"I did when I was a teen, which was over 20 years ago and it was ok.",0
22483,"Try a run/walk method... but it's more of a jog/walk method. Find a time that's comfortable for you (like 1 min run, 30 sec walk for example or do less like 30sec/30sec if necessary). You jog at an even pace (not a sprint) for 1 min (not fast and out of breath) then you walk briskly for 30 sec and recover (basically focus on controlling your breathing), then jog 1 min, walk 30 sec, and so on. Do that over a few training sessions for a set amount of time or distance. Personally I'd do it for longer than whatever you're being tested on. Then you can start to increase the run time or decrease the walk time gradually over several training sessions until you can just run it non-stop while controlling your breathing.  


Remember to keep your body relaxed and not tense (a few deep breaths occasionally can relax you), and focus on breathing. Sometimes it helps to force yourself to rhythm breathe until it becomes more natural. So do in, in, out, out each time a foot strikes the ground (so in on a step, in on a step, out on a step, out on a step). But really the only way to get better at not dying while running is to practice. Even going out three times a week for 10 min sessions will make a huge difference.  


Also, if you want an A, your ultimate goal will be 3 min for each lap. You can train with lap repeats where you try and do one lap at 3 minutes, then take a 3 minute break (or 5 min if you need more to recover), then run the next one at 3 minutes, 3 min break, then the last one at 3 minutes. The idea with repeats is consistency. They might feel easy at first but you need to still hit the time even if you have to slow your pace and feel like you can go harder, because you want all of them to have the same finish time. Basically don't push the first one hard because you won't be able to maintain that consistently every time. You don't want to blow up on your first lap. If you can't do the 3 min yet, then aim for 3:30 each lap. If you can do 3 minutes each lap, next session try for 2:50-2:55 split.",0

The problem is always consistency and my desire to not always have to manage depression symptoms. I've tried vast amounts of supplements, sleep deprivation (which weirdly works), various forms of exercise, cbt, and antidepressants.     Every single one has its downsides and is difficult to do consistently. 

The major one that no one talks about is financial and time orientated. If you have money and a lot of free time to go anywhere and do anything, meet new people, you'll feel major improvements.

22565,"Heck yeah. I would run in downtown Sacramento and and it would take my mind off things. I would run by museums that I would later go to, I ran by old mansions and Victorian houses, and restaurants that I would later go to. It was like urban exploration on foot.
I would also lift weights and go to failure every time and the zen of it all was that I would be hurting to make that last rep. I was so weak from pushing myself but all that mattered was that last rep. My debt didn't matter, it didn't matter that my ex wife kept my kids from me, it didn't matter that I was living in my moms couch for a bit. Nothing matted except.... that last rep.

But it has definitely been a huge help with my depression and amxiety.

Whats helped with my depression is the thought of taking care of a child, the child being me. I ask myself, would you not feed this child? Would you not brush this childs teeth? Would you not shower this child?? Would you not love this child?? That has honestly helped me stay motivated when i start feeling myself slow doen from depression.",0

Her advice regarding weight loss was to proceed very carefully as your body wants to keep a few extra kgs as it's main focus is to produce milk. As you probably already know, things like drastically cutting calories, intense exercise or just not getting enough rest will impact your supply.
But as your baby gets older and moves to solids, they'll need less from you. So if you start slowly and listen to your body and your baby, I'm sure you'll find a balance that works for you.
 In the meantime, you could look at baking your own lactation cookies and cut the sugar from them. There's so many recipes online. I'm eating porridge with flaxseed at breakfast or making smoothies with Oates, flaxseed and brewers yeast in them.",0

I would find ways to incorporate them and see if you can add them into bodyweight exercises.  The r/bodyweightfitness sub is usually a wealth of knowledge when it comes those sorts of exercises.  Generally speaking, the more resistance you can add to workout, the less reps you have to do and time you have to take in order to get something out of it.  

Exercises like reverse lunges, reverse crunches, oblique crunches, pushups and variations, or even handstand pushups against a wall would all make the cut for me if I were pursuing this sort of regimen for myself.  Resistance bands could probably improve some of these as well, and can also make a few different back exercises available which is a tough group to target without equipment.",0

Second, there is NO reason to be ashamed. It's not like you sat down one day and thought ""yeah, I'm gonna be lazy now."" The fact that you fell out of shape is completely normal and not at all anything to be ashamed about. Life happens. (And for the record, even if you HAD decided just to be lazy one day, there would be nothing at all to be ashamed about if you were going to the gym and trying to get back into shape. You're striving to better yourself-- it's something to be proud of!)

I can almost guarantee you that no one at the gym is judging you- they're just there to work out &amp; unless they frequent the gym, they're probably not paragons of fitness either. The fact that you're even going to the gym shows courage that a lot of people lack.

Would it help to do exercises that you didn't do before? As in, I used to run on an actual track, and now I run along the road I live on- if that makes sense. Maybe it would feel better if you couldn't compare what you're doing now to what you were able to do then.

Also, as corny as it feels to do, whenever your brain is like ""wow, you really suck"" fire back with a ""I'm doing good."" Like, it's weird to do, but it's impossible to suppress impulsive negative thoughts about yourself, but you can always follow it up with a positive thought.

22605,"You need a kick in the ass to motivate yourself and you need a plan.  You and I OP are similar in age and i have been through what you have been through. Sick parents and all. I woke up 4 months ago at my heaviest ever and had no motivation to get better. My moment came when my wife called me fat and said i was super lazy.  She did it in a joking way but it really pissed me off.  I told myself i need to make some changes.  The next day i went on a diet and started working out.

Here's your road map.

Monday morning your going on a diet.   Do research this weekend and come up with something easy. What i did was cinco.  I counted calories. I weighed 260 and cut my calories to 1400 per day. I used the lose it app.  Try to cut bread out of your diet, try to cut carbs as best you can, quit drinking,  no BEER (huge for me), eat fruit for breakfast, eat salads for lunch, use portion control for supper, no snacking at night.   

Get plenty of sleep go to bed early.  I made sure i was in bed at 9:30 pm every night no exceptions, except weekends maybe 10:00.  I would wake up at 5:30 am and work out. Do what's best for your schedule.  (not going to lie this was a huge change for me and required a lot of discipline)

Work out and do cardio 4 days a week, 1 day a week lift weights. Start slow and every day do a little more than the day before. My first day i ran  100 yds and walked 1 mile, ran another 100 yds walked 1 mile.  The next day i ran 200 yds and walked 1 mile. Just try to do a little better than the day before.  Today i ran 5 miles.. and it's what i do 4 days a week.  Build up slow and do whats best for you, biking what ever.  Track all exercise on lose it and watch the calories.  Do this for 8 weeks.  After that reevaluate and come up with a new plan.  I promise you will lose 25-30 lbs and the soreness will be a good sore the type that make you feel alive and not broken. People will notice. I'm at 218 and everyone notices. 

Another thing i did was work on my relationship with my wife.. Paid more attention to her , checked in every morning   
 and communicated more and did a few small things better.   Tried to pull more moves in the sack as well.  you get my idea.      

Here's the most important part. 

Do not talk about this diet and plan don't make a big deal about it.  Everyone will want to tell you this and tell you that.  My wife rolls her eyes i'm on a diet again, kids are shitty that dad is doing something for himself.  Everyone is in better shape.  My experience at gyms is most people don't really care what your up to and if someone gives you the stink eye they can go f off and are probably miserable any way.  This is about you and only you and you need to do this for your self.  If you don't want to do it for your self do this plan for me a random guy typing wisdom on his lunch break who knows what your going thru. No one give a a crap about a 45 year old me and 47 year old you but i do and many other product of the 90s do to. 

Don't be ashamed it happens to all of us.  Good luck and don't give up.",0

Don't give up you have decades ahead!! :) I'm at my strongest I've ever been now but it has been a real journey. Like others said - pay attention to the food, it is the biggest contributor to the weight. Can you meal prep? I learned some basic recipes and pre-package them on the weekends when I don't have time to cook regularly - brown rice &amp; chicken breast &amp; veggies, egg white sandwich for breakfast, some simple healthy casseroles - basic stuff that may not be the most thrilling but is good and nutritious and doesn't break my wallet or waist.

Exercise slowly, the change will come over time. I started really paying attention to my fitness again last January and its taken a bit but I've gotten so much stronger and fitter just making gradual increases in intensity and upping my routines. No one is judging you at the gym, everyone is just focused on themselves, which is great!

Getting back in shape is hard work, no doubt about it.  But if you start to let go of your worries of being judged, you might find that it gets a little easier.

Also, give yourself permission to be happy about the progress you have made.  Getting back to where you used to be can be a long-term goal.  Adding one more rep/set, 2 more minutes, and feeling a little less sore in the morning are all attainable short-term goals that can help keep you focused and motivated.

It's why you hear how a person who fed their dog vegan food can be still alive, they are getting protein, but they are not thriving.

They also have a hard solid base to help you ""push the ground"", unlike running shoes which have more of a cushion for the sole. 

I would not use the weightlifting shoes as a crutch, you should able to get into a good, strong squat barefoot. 

As for lunges, which leg do you feel the pain in? I would also try some different variations like Bulgarian split squats, reverse lunges, step ups, step down lunges just to maybe see if your body like something else better.

22669,"1 hour sessions were much more beneficial for me than 30 minutes. My goal for personal training was not just the increased fitness and to lose weight at the time, but also to learn from a professional and the longer sessions gave us much more time to explore and explain. 30 minutes felt much too rushed, and seem to really only be offered by the big-box chain gyms. On my off days I worked out on my own. So it may depend on what you personally want from the experience. I learned a whole lot, much more than I ever could from self-study, and now workout at home alone with a few free weights and HIIT bodyweight routines (don't have the $ anymore for gym or trainer). I'm now in the best shape of my life and stronger than ever :)

When shopping for a personal trainer I found that interviewing and finding someone you actually want to spend time with is important. Also going to a small local gym versus the big chain gyms was a much much better environment. I found my favorite trainer through a local google search, it is a small company just a team of 3 trainers who had a preferred local gym, but they did not work for the gym they are independent. My trainer also focused extensively on my diet and that made such a tremendous difference in everything. Good luck!!",0

To work your glute medius include more lateral movements into your workouts. Use the hip abduction machine and bands. God buy a lot of bands. Do seated clamshells while you sit at work.

22736,"Losing weight... eat less. But...

Growth requires fuel so to grow muscles you’ll have to eat more. To decrease body fat you need to be mindful of what you eat (carbs, fat, protein) and be strict about the amounts of each. Eat more protein for growth, carbs for energy but also fat to help break it down. You need to balance each. I’d say come up with a meal plan, try it out for a few weeks and then see the results. Then you can tweak it every few weeks until you see exactly the results you want. It’s not a quick process. 

As far as cardio vs lifting vs etc... it depends on your goal. Cardio is always good but only lifting isn’t a bad thing either. Regardless, any plan getting you to workout is better than not. Try out just lifting and maybe add in cardio when you adjust your meal plan. Just know with cardio comes the need for more carbs for energy and protein/fat for recovery.

You can damage your muscles so much (positive adaptation is related to mechanical tension NOT muscle damage anyway) so that you're adaptation is catabolic (smaller muscles) instead of anabolic (bigger muscles.)  

If you're trying to lose weight you can work at such an intensity that your body doesn't have enough available oxygen to use fat as a fuel source.  

Muscle soreness is not a prerequesite of positive training gains.  Do some research, figure out the smartest way to hit your goals and then work smart, not hard.",0
22752,"A lot of great advice here but I actually would not go higher reps, lower weight.  You can get significant hypertrophy (muscle growth) from high repetition sets.  As exercise science marches onward we are learning that you rep schemes (3 = strength, 12 = size, 20 = endurance) are not as gospel-truth, set-in-stone as we used to think they were.  

So I'm going to try to make this direct, concise and most importantly: not boring.  Here'goes.  Mechanical tension causes muscles to grow.  NOT muscle soreness.  NOT muscle damage.  So there's a whole bunch of boring exercise science that comes in here but what that boring stuff means is that with high rep sets you are going to systematically direct mechanical tension to most if not all of the fibers because of how those high reps are going to fatigue your muscles.  

What that means is that you are going to see all of those gain**Z** across each of those fibers so that they each enjoy a non-negligible amount of growth.

But there's good news here.  We can separate the idea of training for strength from training for size.  Those two goals use different strategies.  Don't give up being strong.  Stronger people are safer and more capable.  You can retain your strength and get smaller, tighter and toner.  

Here's the strategy: we have to find a way to increase your ability to express strength without creating so much mechanical tension (across a small muscular region) that we see a meaningful degree of muscle growth.  

I think the best way for you to move forward is going to be some kind of HIIT styled kettlebell class.  HIIT was originally designed to help mid-distance athletes burn fuel more efficiently over long competition periods.  What does that mean?  Doesn't matter but it was definitely not designed to produce mechanical tension and to build big athletes.  

Kettlebells are good because its a whole body movement so that 'mechanical tension' is dispersed over large muscular regions.  There is also a degree to which POWER training (strength = move a heavy thing but power= move a heavy thing quickly) is involved.  Power training is usually not compatible with getting big (for more boring ExSci reasons.)

HIIT was hugely popular over the last decade so now there are tons of group fitness classes that aren't HIIT but use the HIIT terminology/labeling.  I think joining any one of those is going to be in line with your goals.  And the same is true for finding a Kettlebell based group fitness setting.  Either one of those should help to keep you strong without doing too much of a hypertrophy-based training model.",0
22753,"Okay so you started out with jumping rope.  But this is an extremely difficult thing to do.  Don't underestimate jumping rope.  There isn't anything wrong with your leg, ankle or foot.  Think about what the muscles across your ankle (in your shin) have to do.  In like a second they have to slow you down and the propel you back off of the ground again.  

And that's not ""reps"" you're doing this what 20 times in a stretch?  Counting to 50?  That's not to mention all of the reps you are adding if the rope hits your leg or you get tripped up.  And this is only to speak to regular jump roping.  How about the force you need to generate for a double-under?  A triple under?  How about if you are skipping?  All of that weight repetitively down over a SINGLE leg.  

So how about the numbness?  Well without some kind of clinical exam I can say absolutely nothing useful about what might be going on here.  Go see a doctor and get this looked at.  If I might make a very non-diagnostic, armchair stab (which, again, in no way constitutes any sort of medical or clinical interaction between you and I) I would wonder if its maybe the deep peroneal nerve being irritated (not pinched, not squeeze, not damaged...just chemically irritated) by an anterior tibialis and a family of ankle \[dorsi\]flexors who are having to work really, really hard in a short time across that nerve.  

Go see a doctor, get yourself cleared for participation with exercise.  And on an exercise selection level I would tell you to stop *jumping rope*.  Don't stop forever, stop for now because its a hard thing that you are going to work back up to.  

Definitely do not stop exercising, though.  Especially if you are THIRTY.  If you are 30 then you should expect positive health outcomes from exercise for at least the next like... 40 years.  

As far as cardio vs strength training goes I'll just say this: strong people are better conditioned against the likelihood of pain and injury than less strong people.  You can do strength based training and enjoy the benefits of both strength and cardio adaptation.  However, cardio (while a totally valid choice, none of this has to be a black and white, open and shut situation) will only stimulate task-specific cardio and endurance adaptations.",0
22754,"In the short term some people feel tired or energized shortly after exercising. For some it is dependent on the type of exercise (aerobic Vs anaerobic ). For me I feel less stressed minutes after exercising and ready for bed within a few hours (regardless of time of day). 

Being physically fit from exercise while giving your body regular exercise leads to improved energy. This is similar to how exercise improves your heart’s efficiency over time. This is true across all people. Over time people find that they remember waking fewer times each night and have more energy in the mornings/during the day. 

I have a history of sleeping problems too so I like to remind myself that people with “normal” sleep patterns wake up multiple times each night too, it is just that I become more alert and stay awake when I am dealing with insomnia. So I wasn’t too far off from normal, I just needed to focus on reducing stress and encouraging relaxation through various techniques.",0
22756,"Yeah mb you are right, your primary focus is indeed those lower back muscles, you are not cheating for those. But catching that cattle bell with a straight arm will put all the force on your shoulder joint and elbow as your bicep and tricep dont support a lot when not tensed. You also put your back at risk as it is a lot of weight which is located under your shoulders, so you will naturally get a little arch when the weight goes down with some fallspeed, which your back then absorbs. Doing exercises at 46 is great! But i think this exercise is not the ideal one for core, as it puts too much strain on your back and shoulder, i would recommend other core/back/shoulder exercises which keep your back more balanced and dont require your arms compensating for a falling weight.",0

Can't help with the specific problems you had there, but if they are still prominent after a week of exercise, see a physician. Ultimately it is you who knows what feels 'right' for you body.

To offer some motivation: Previously I was almost completely sedentary. I've been going about 3 weeks, and it does get (a bit) better. 

What I did personally, was start small. About 1km on the rowing machine then very light weights, did that for a week, then increased a bit.

If there's a twinge anywhere, or something doesn't feel right, I stop and take a break. Maybe even leave that exercise to the next day.

22778,"Depends. But depending on what level you are with training, you will adapt and if you keep pushing the same weight you wont become as sore. You are esentially tearing muscle. The body reacts by building more back on to get ready for next time.",0
22779,"You can still train upper body/arms, but maybe prioritize other muscle groups over arms specifically. For example, instead of bicep/tricep workouts, do chest or back. Generally speaking, chest exercises tend to have the triceps muscles act as an ""accessory"" to the movement while back exercises utilize biceps for their movement. 

Think about the elbow joint action during a push up. When you press off the floor your elbows extend which contract your triceps (joint action of tricep contraction is elbow extension). 

Now think about the elbow joint action during a back row. your elbows flex which contract your biceps (joint action of bicep contraction is elbow flexion)

During both of these examples your main lift is contracting either the chest or back while utilizing secondary muscles to help the movement perform. You are still activating tris/bis but you are doing so in a manner that wont necessarily build and make your arms bigger. 

You can also focus on muscular endurance rather than muscular strength (more reps at lighter weight rather than less reps at heavier weight).

1) Know that your body is capable, adaptable and heals itself.  Know that you're in control of what happens next and are capable of healing yourself

2) EXPECT that you're going to get yourself out of pain.  Don't just ""try something.""  ""Don't see what happens."" Choose something and be confident.  

3) Do whatever is fun.  Planks if planks are fun.  Pilates if pilates is fun.  Find a healthy movement that is fun and you feel good about.  Do that and expect to get out of pain because you have the capability to get yourself out of pain regardless of what specific ""thing"" you're choosing to do.

If you're completely on your own, at least add in some careful exercise for your back muscles (you may have to start very slow/with very little weight and carefully listen to your body as you build up back muscles).

Your body will definitely let you know if say, you haven't gotten much fiber, and the next day you're eating a bunch of greens, beans, and other fibrous foods.

As for exercising, building more muscle will help burn fat faster. I would suggest more compound exercises (I. E. Squats, deadlifts, etc.). But remember! Form is crucial. Any exercise you aren't familiar with, do it without weights first. Then gradually increase your weights. Recording yourself is probably the best way to really check your form.

Another fun fact, since our bodies adapt to our environment, doing the same exact exercises over and over will have declining results. Make sure you switch it up! Even if you just switch out one of your exercises that'll make a difference. 

One last thing, I think it's great that you want to take care of your body! Keep it up!",0

If your primary goal is body transformation, I would look into lifting heavy weights. Lifting heavy weights is the most direct route to increase your bodies’ lean muscle tissue (this does not mean you’ll get big and bulky, that comes with the diet).",0
22921,"While I agree with the post above, a non dietary technique you can use is heavy lifting. By lifting heavier weights (weights that will limit you to 2-8 reps) you will increase your bodies lean muscle tissue. Lean muscle tissue is our bodies fat burning machinery and will be what helps you burn more fat during those fasted states.  Also, sleep plays a big factor in body composition as well, as it’s evolutionary purposes is for recovery. Transforming your sleep will help you to transform every aspect of your health.",0

22981,"Depends... How saggy? Are they saggy from being overweight, age, or from breastfeeding. 

I think if they are saggy from being over weight they would firm up as you lose the weight. If you are really heavy and lose the weight fast I imagine they would still be saggy just like all that excess skin around the belly that happens in that situation.

If you are in good physical shape and you're just getting older then I think you just have to accept that's how your boobs are now.

Some women when breastfeeding they keep their perkiness... some or maybe most women who have a child, their boobs fill with milk and their boobs grow, then the milk is gone and their boobs are kinda deflated looking. Just the luck of the draw. Aren't genetics great?

In any case bench press will firm up your chest muscles but there's some sag that just won't go away. Also, boobs are almost all fat, so if you lose weight your breasts will get smaller and hopefully perkier. Depending on genetics and what your boobs have been through.

You could get a breast lift or breast implants if it really bothers you.",0

Today I want to show you how to master the double arm landmine press and turn this excellent pressing exercise into a staple in your program. 

**Coaching Tips:**

==&gt; Stand feet shoulder-width apart 

==&gt; Angle the body towards the bar so your leaning on the bar instead of standing straight up and down. 

==&gt; As you press up with the bar, shift slightly forward so that the weight is being absorbed by the entire body and not just the shoulders and low back. 

==&gt; Strive for perfect form and 100% control over the weight and movement.

Keep in mind going off keto you will increase water weight really quickly at first,  don't be alarmed its just water weight from adding carbs and lifting.  So you'll probably puff up pretty fast for the first few weeks, but that will level off.  So let the mirror be your judge instead of the scale, until you settle in.",0

In today's video, I am going to show you the landmine front squat. A back pain friendly leg exercise you can do if you have an Olympic bar and a corner or an actual landmine set up. 

**Key Coaching Tips:** 

1) Adjust your body to the bar, the bar won't adjust to you.

3) For the front squat keep the bar centered in your chest.

Obviously I'm being passive aggressive in the OP, because I don't think rules should ever be open to interpretation.

I understand that it would be silly to post a photo of your MRI with the caption, ""Does this look like cancer to you?"" That's obviously not what this subreddit is for.

23054,"1. It’s always good to be cleared by a doctor before exercise. Heart rate recovery is an indication of cardiovascular fitness. The faster it comes down the more fit you are. It sounds like you need more recovery.

2. Chest straps are better for accurate heart rate readings. Hand straps from my experience are slower and less accurate.

3. The equation, (220 - age) = max heart rate, is not accurate. The only way to check max heart rate is to push yourself to the max. This is done with a VO2 Max test. I find heart rate training and perceived exertion to be equally useful for beginners who are doing interval training.

4. High Intensity interval training (HIIT)is the best way to create cardiovascular adaption and see a dramatic improvement in recovery heart rate. The following is an example using perceived exertion:

3min easy
2min medium 
1 min hard
30sec Sprint 

Repeat 2-3 times

5. Since you have shin splints I would focus on base building (easy/medium intensity) until the pain goes away. Once pain free start once a week and then build to twice a week of HHIT.

6. Shin Splints are a symptom of overtraining. It sounds like you increased your miles too fast. Drop your miles and run on a treadmill. A treadmill is far softer then the road. Also consider shoes that are made for running (if you don’t already have them).

7. HIIT helps to boast excess post oxygen consumption (Epoc). Epoc will increase the fat you burn for 24-48hrs and help with weight loss.

23058,"This doesn't necessarily apply to your high heart rate when working out, but for runs you should slow down.  Even though you are running a lot, if you're running at too high a percent of your max heart rate all the time it's counter productive.  You need to make yourself slow down, or even walk, so you can get some nice base level runs in there which will strengthen your baseline fitness level.  I'm going to butcher this, and hopefully someone with more knowledge will explain what I'm trying to say, but your body is more efficient at clearing lactic acid when your heart is beating at a moderately elevated rate vs going nearly max.  You need to strengthen your body's ability to do this for extended periods of time.   Going hard has its advantages (increasing your threshold level, weight loss, psychological strengthening, etc.), but if you're just trying to get in generally better shape you need to work on your base level of fitness.  If I were you I would figure out what an ""easy"" target heart rate zone for exercise is for your body and make sure you do some runs/walks where you stay in that zone.  I prefer the formulas that factor in your max and resting heart rates when determining zones (see Karvonen method).  In my case they tend to be way more accurate than just % of max heart rate.  Here's a link to calculating your zones:

[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/ask-a-health-expert/whats-the-best-way-to-calculate-my-heart-rate-zones/article1322123/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/ask-a-health-expert/whats-the-best-way-to-calculate-my-heart-rate-zones/article1322123/)

Depending on what brand of watch your using to get your HR they may calculate this automatically for you (you may need to tweak the method it uses to grab your zones).

23065,"The way I do them is with my elbows bent close  the sides and in 4 positions, depressed and protracted, depressed and retracted, elevated and protracted, and elevated and retracted. 

They are done against a high elevated surface so you barely put any weight on it. It is more about focusing on keeping the shoulders in that exact position while you extend the arm. I would consider this a mobility exercise as opposed to loaded. I wouldnt recommend it below say waist height.

In certain positions, I find it better to use a supinated hand position as i find you can increase the range of motion depending on what position you are in. 

I discovered this while working towards a Planche, and im seeing great progress in both that, and my Front Lever and L-Sit since incorporating this. 

For example, the pronated and elevated position is basically doing a push up with the shoulder position of a planche.

What all these exercises have in common is straight arm strength. I think for most people, its not that their arms arent strong enough, i think they just lack the lock out power in their shoulders amd back. This exercise is felt from my lats to my traps. Especially my traps.",0
23066,"You can’t target fat loss to a specific area, so you will need to focus on general fat loss. It really depends how your body holds fat on how long/hard it will be to get rid of it. You can tone the muscles underneath by working on your Lat’s. 

A healthy diet is key to fat loss and working out what works best for you is really important. You need to be in a slight calorie deficit to burn fat but not so much that you don’t have sufficient nutrients and fuel for your body. 

As for fat loss, I’d do a mixture of cardio and weights. E.g. 3/4 times a week do muscle building and then go on a walk 4+ times a week for about 30mins to an hour or 30 mins on the cross trainer at the end of your workout. I work in a gym and we get a lot of questions like this so this is what I always recommend - especially if you’re busy/just starting out.

23068,"A couple of months back, I was at 154 lbs, 5'3 22F. And I did this for a while. Started with 45 minutes at the gym and used to speed walk on the treadmill for 15 mins, run for 3 intermittently. And slowed it for another 2 and finished. I used to row as well for 20 minutes and some other exercise for 5-10 minutes. 
I am a vegetarian as well. So I used MyFitnessPal for counting calories and then walked everywhere instead of using Uber or Lyft. 
A month later, I lost 9lbs. And 6 weeks later, hit a weight loss plateau. So, I shifted to swimming and running. Found out that running and swimming was not my cup of tea. 
So, I tried classpass and joined a modified pilates gym close to my house and that's been really really helpful. 
Currently at 129lbs after 160 days of consistent diet and workouts. (29% body fat)
This worked pretty well for me but it was all trial and error and key is to stay consistent. Don't diet too much and stop eating on the whole. A good diet and proper rest is required to help your body heal and stay healthy.

Are there any other factors involved such as medicines or supplements (caffeine)? Make sure nothing external is causing high HR if you feel like you could be physically working harder. 

It is ok to have a high heart rate since you are just beginning exercising as long as you have no other symptoms like dizziness or shortness of breath. Continued training will decrease heart rate. Also remember sometimes our fit bits are not totally correct. Maybe try taking your heart rate manually if it feels high. 

I suggest running at a very easy pace and practice breathing.

Your better eating 500 calories above maintenance to support growth, eat a good mix of lean protein, complex carbs, and good fats.

Use protein shakes in between meals, they are supplements not replacements.

Also you need good fats for adequate hormone production etc.

I’ll give you an example of what I eat, I’m 5ft 10 and 85kg at 10% body fat so I have some decent muscle mass on me.

Breakfast - 80g of oats, 20g protein powder, 20g coconut oil, one banana, 5ml of olive oil, tablespoon of raw peanut butter ( not the store crap) blended into a shake.

Meal 2 - 2 Salmon fillets, new potatoes, broccoli.

Protein shake

Meal 3 - chicken, sweet potato mash, broccoli.

Meal 4 - steak, rice, broccoli or other veg.

This is just an example but it’s the type of foods I eat.
I swap things around and sometimes have like 4-5 eggs on wholemeal toast for breakfast or meal 2. 

Stick to real whole foods, ignore processed and high sugar foods, train consistently and you’ll see progress, I’ve been training for 10 years and I can see changes in as little as 2 weeks but my body is well adapted, you’ll see growth within 4 weeks and others should notice it within 6 weeks, remember it is a marathon and not a sprint, it takes years to grow serious mass.",0

First off, every single person has a different body type, and metabolism, so I cant say what exactly will work for you, but this is what i found to be a manageable routine. 

background:

M 5’11”

170-190lbs 7th-12th grade

&gt;155 since soph year of college (4 years ago)

at the tail end of my heavier phase I was not getting any exercise, smoking a gram of oil daily, and eating complete shit 24/7, felt broken, and horrible about my future. In addition, my weight problem, although minor, had a dramatic negative impact on all of my relationships. 

This regime started rather suddenly, and has evolved over time.


I began completing the following exercises in this order 5-6 days a week MINIMUM (6th &amp; 7th days can be lighter exercise, but it’s vital to stay active every single day):

Light stretching, focusing on posture related areas such as the back or the hamstrings 

1-6 miles of jogging (treadmill, road, woodlands) A well paced jog can be an efficient fat burning exercise, and helps get warmed up. The longer you’re willing to go the better.

3 x 30 sets of each of the following:

SitUps/Crunches 

Push ups

Standing squats (no weights needed)

If you can, throw some side-to-side crunches in there for the obliques 

3 x 1-3min planks (push yourself, but start short and work your way up)



DIET, HUGE:

Cut ALL fast foods, simple carbs which means: processed white grains, white pasta, pizza, etc. This will be tough as our bodies tend to crave such items especially when exercising, but this is crucial. If you have to eat fast food, aim for something decent like chipotle or qdoba and pay attention to the calorie count. You need less ghan 2k calories per day if you want to lose weight, and it’s easy to crush that in one meal at some o these joints.

Cut all high fructose corn syrup, and as much excess sugar/fats as possible. Might have to start reading the labels but it’ll pay off.

DO, eat complex carbs such as whole grain bread/pasta, low fat proteins like egg white or quinoa. Veggies could be a staple in your diet as well.

The diet part will seem tough, but your body literally adjusts overtime and your perception will grow to appreciate healthier foods over the processed garbage that’s shoved in our faces.


As someone who was out of shape for most of their youth, my life has flipped 180 and only for the better since i got my health in check.

My thought would be to do bodyweight only pilates: Leg raises, Scissor Kicks, Pendulums, etc.  [FitnessBlender] (https://www.youtube.com/user/FitnessBlender/search?query=pilates) is great. You get out of pilates what you're able to put in. The slower and more precise your movements the better the results.",0
23155,"Being lean is 80% based on what you eat. You approximately burn just over 100 calories running a mile but eat 1 piece of pizza and take in 300 calories. So there’s that side of it.

The hyper trophy part is more based on overloading muscles. So like the other person had said lifting weights 4-5 days a week and constantly pushing your limits is the goal there.

A big misconception about pushing yourself while lifting weights is that a lot of people think that means you need to always be pushing your 1RM. As much as I used to do this I have recently seen a lot better results with focusing on form and taking my time. I can get a crazy big pump while doing supinate curls with 20lbs dumbbells while a guy half my size is curling 40lbs dumbbells and flailing all over the place. Just something to keep in mind.

I’d suggest going on to athlean-x on YouTube and learn as much as you can. Jeff does an excellent job teaching biomechanics .",0

23162,"Pretty much. You won’t necessarily need to lift say 5 times a week or keep increasing the weights, you’d just need to lift 3-4 times a week with current weights and reps. Integrate stretching and eccentric loading (meaning controlling lowering the weights) to maintain your current muscle bulk, give preference to multi joint exercises over single joint ones. I’m currently doing just that and I can comfortably maintain my muscle mass and don’t injure myself with heavy weights. Been working out for 13 years now, have a degree in exercise science and physical therapy so I know that much",0
23163,"So after the 18 weeks, after building the foundation with endurance and strength, keep lifting heavy to keep hypertrophy???",0
23164,"If you’ve achieved hypertrophy with heavy weights and 8-10 reps then you’d most likely start losing some of the muscle mass if you don’t keep training with heavy weights. In order for you to maintain the level of hypertrophy you need to continue with the appropriate stimulus to the muscles, so light weights and many sets would probably not work. Those are the essence of principles of reversibility and specificity.",0
23165,"Try 5x5.

Strength based programs working out the whole body 3 times a week are optimal people that train naturally. So squats and deadlifts should be the base of your program. Mainly because the amount of muscles used allow you to lift heavy weights.


Focus on getting stronger and muscle will come as a result. But gains of strength and muscle will slow down as your progress.

Muscle should be the result not the goal.  Your goal should be getting stronger.

Try it out.",0

A quick stop through the drive through is MUCH more alluring after a long day at work, day after day with very few or even zero days off, which is the reality for many people and their families. While one may be able to *choose* to do these things, it may not be what's practical or easy enough for them to manage on top of a litany of other things that people living in poverty must manage, especially when their circumstances make it even harder to access healthy food options regularly. If I had to worry about whether or not I would have enough money to pay bills and handle any other less-expected financial issues that may arise, allocating time and energy toward putting healthy food on the table would not be a prioritized concern of mine as much as just getting food on the table. It may be a possibility, but that doesn't mean people should be expected to do so, and shaming people for not doing so definitely isn't going to change things.",0

23179,"Check out income quintiles in the US. I was discouraged because I thought I was somewhere around the middle to find out I'm in the upper quintile. I'm not rich, I don't have a huge house or drive a luxury vehicle (we do eat healthy food instead of fast food), but I certainly never would have dreamed that I'm wealthier than 80% of the country. Fun fact the mean income of the bottom 20% of the country is only around 13k per year. All the way up to the 3rd quintile, that's the true ""middle class"" as in the middle income earners the household income is around 61k. That's household income. That's depressing. The problem is that people like me, unless I actively seek to learn more tend to associate normal income and high income with the people we interact with. Since I know people that make 300k a year, I felt like I had a lot of bandwith to go further (and I do I suppose), but I assumed I was the average earner. I'm only in the upper quintile because my wife and I both make decent incomes.

Why am I saying all this? You said the wide majority of people, take a look at the bottom two quintiles and think about that 40% of the country makes that much for an entire household. That income supports a family. Sure there's single wage earners mixed in, but many of them are supporting a family on that. I thought we were better than that as a country. It's eye opening.",0

In fact, when I first started working with a personal trainer, I had to stop halfway through our first workout, since we were working too hard, and I knew I was going to faint and/or vomit. 

There's nothing wrong with an hour of exercise a week. It's a great start. Feel comfortable making that a part of your schedule before trying to do more. The difference between being a person who never exercises, to one who is getting their heart rate up twice a week takes a while to shift.

Things that help exercising steadily, for me, are making it part of my schedule, having an accountability partner/gym buddy, having it be somewhat social (like joining a running group, or taking a workout class), and doing different things.

When you’ve consumed food to around 2 or so hours later, your body has increased blood flow for churning in the stomach and intestinal motility. Your metabolism is shifted toward breaking down and processing incoming nutrients and cycling out the waste. It requires a lot of secretion, a lot of brush-like movement of the ciliated cells of the digestive tract, and mucus secretion to both prevent tissue breakdown from its own process and to help ‘move things along’. All of that action requires a lot of mediating hormones, nerve signalling, and general cellular energy.

23310,"Hi I'm no athlete by any means, but I do exercise regularly. About four years back, I got into the routine of exercising for about an hour (sometimes more) six days a week. I mainly run, but recently, I got into some strength training using my body weight and a pull up bar. What I find really helpful is to do some light stretching, then to jog about 1/2 a mile then to stretch intensely before continuing running. Notice that I used the words jogging and running distinctly. After I'm done running, I do a cool down lap or two where I just walk and finish with some slow, calming stretching.

I think that adequately stretching will help with your soreness but also to prevent injury. Some people argue that muscle soreness means your muscles are growing due to being put under stress. When we exercise, our muscles get microtears in them, which then lead to increased blood flow to those areas and the tissue is repaired. Now, are the microtears the only reason for the soreness? Probably not. Youre definitely accumulating lactic acid in your muscle cells during a workout, which can be adding to the soreness you are experiencing. I believe this is called DOMS.

As exercising becomes more routine, the soreness should subside as you become accustomed to the intensity. If you keep changing it up or focusing on different muscle groups each day of the week, you might come across soreness again. Best of luck, and glad youre making good choices",0

23348,"Assuming that you are healthy but just de conditioned, I would start off by joining a gym and get started with light barbells for biceps curls and triceps pull downs. You may find it beneficial to choose the machines that actually allow you to perform multijoint exercises, such as lat pull downs, pec flys, etc. Try out doing the bench press with just the bar, add weights slowly and only when you can maintain good posture without curling your back, squats with light weights and good form. You want to alternate each body region or the principle muscle that is doing the work every other day, leave at least 1 day without lifting, and stretch at least 3 times a week. Shoot for light weights with 15-20 repetitions for each exercise. Allow yourself 1-2 full minutes to recover in between each set, though. Slowly try to do wall pushups, followed by table pushups- meaning hands on the table, feet on the ground, and finally graduate to kneeling pushups and regular pushups. Be aware of the effect called delayed onset of muscle soreness, which presents with some pain and soreness of muscles followed most strength workouts with eccentric components, it’s perfectly normal.

The thing is, I lost a lot of muscle mass since I took an operation on my affected leg to make it better, but it went south and I had to spend almost a year with crutches, unable to put any weight on it, so that made all my muscles shorten even more, which means that whenever I take super long walks my tendons are not used to that kind of stress being put on them and sometimes it feels as if they were about to snap, it's a horrible pain, which is why i have ruled out cardio completely.

Is it a matter of strengthening your knees? Or will they always swell/become painful? I don't know enough about cerebral palsy. For me, I have to work on strengthening, so it all comes down to moderation... Building the muscles up slowly. Most exercises will involve your knees to some extent, unfortunately.

Do you have any specific fitness goals? If it's just overall health you're looking for, I would suggest lots of walking (no hills, if possible) and seeing about wheelchair sports or those arm bicycle things. You may not require a wheelchair for anything else, but it would be a great opportunity to work on core and arm strength without putting any stress on your knees. Just depends on your budget, location, etc. 

Other than that.... There's probably a bunch of strength training you could do at the gym without putting too much strain on your knees. Yoga will probably help too, or maybe a light martial art like Tai Chi. Unfortunately, almost all regular cardio will hurt your knees unless you take them out of the equation completely (like with a wheelchair).

I've found that biking doesn't sit well with my knees either (no cerebral palsy but skeletal disformities affecting my knees). If I want to do cardio, I walk on a treadmill, at as fast a pace as I can comfortably sustain without pain or strain. I usually also walk at an incline as I personally find it easier on my knees (2-3%). The good thing about a treadmill is that you can hold onto the rails for added stability/balance if you need to.

Obviously if you want the best results I'd recommend speaking to a personal trainer as they will craft a plan designed for your body. Otherwise, just try different exercises, look up plans online. Just stick with it. I didn't see any noticeable results for roughly the first 6-8 weeks but again everyone is different.",0
23412,Agreed with this but it’s also important to let your body recover when it needs to. More exercise &gt; less but too much exercise will cause more stress,0
23413,"Thank you! And the strength exercise you do is meant to tone not bulk right? I’m a female so I’d rather not get all bulky. I know it’s hard to get that without wanting to, but I just want to be sure. So if I do it this way: 3 times a week running half an hour, which is about 5k, and the exercises you listed above 3 times a week will it then tone me, and make me in overall better shape? Also how much weight can I expect to lose? I’m on the slim side so I’d rather not lose a ton. When do you think I will start to see results?",0
23414,"If you're hoping to improve your running as well, change your route up every now and then to keep your body performing. You won't notice a difference immediately, it all takes time but if you stick to it then yes you'll notice a difference. 

Typically I do; 2 mins press-up, 4x15 lunges, 4x 20 squats, 4x20 dorsal raises, 2 mins sit-ups, 4x12 tricep-dips. That's 3 days a week and I run 5k 6 days a week. However, I am a male and this is Army fitness. So it's entirely up to you how to proceed with your routines. There are a tonne of guides online around toning exercises and people find different exercises more useful than others. 

Bare in mind with all exercise it's important to stay hydrated and eat balanced meals. Don't be afraid of carbs as they'll fuel your body, eat protein and healthy fats are okay. Just try to avoid junk food and sugary drinks and you'll notice a difference in time.",0
23415,"Currently I don’t have any distance in mind, and I am aiming for a steady pace. I want to look more toned. Will the 2 days of strength training provide that? Do you have any routines for the toning exercise?",0
23416,"Have you got a distance in mind when running? Are you aiming for a steady pace or intervals? 

Running will help you lose weight and you will obviously build more muscle in your legs. It's good for your heart too as is most aerobic exercise. 

When you say look fitter do you mean toned or to look bigger? If you're looking to tone up it's important to also do core exercises (push ups, sit ups, planks, etc.) So have a look at those. Squats are also good, add weight to make more of an impact. 

Boxing is mainly an aerobic exercise and will provide a workout for all your body. 

Honestly, the most important thing is to ease into it if you haven't been exercising recently. Don't push too hard or you'll be prone to injury. Absolutely don't exercise if you get injured. You'll make it worse.  Start on lighter weights and don't push yourself to the point of exhaustion when running.",0
23417,"I’ll have to look in to this, but it does sound about right! Not sure if frequently exercising with frequent boosts of endorphins will encourage ones body to adapt to the stress over time so that a break won’t be as detrimental, or if taking a break then powering through the first workout when ‘psychologically fatigued’ will be overcome due to endorphins. 

I do believe tiredness is most often a psychological thing, the amount of times I’ve felt ‘too tired’ then manned up and told myself ‘it’s just psychological’ and then done a brilliant work out! Thank you for reminding of this ☺️",0
23418,"Interesting, I’ve been upping my protein shakes but have been getting more meat cravings. I’ll take it as a sign I should eat more! Thank you",0

23448,"Oh good, OMAD should be much easier to do on keto! 

As for tips, hmmm... Do you read r/keto? It's really good and provides some good, basic info. And when I first started out, I got a bunch of info from ketodietblog.com and ruledme.com. 

I guess my main tip would be to figure out your macros (how much fat, protein, and carbs to eat) and consider tracking your calories. (OMAD will certainly make this easier, 'cause, you know, fewer meals to track!) I use a free app to track macros and calories, Carb Manager. 

Mind you, some people just do what's called 'lazy keto', meaning sort-of tracking macros in your head and following the basic keto principles. It works for some, but I noticed that when I did that, I wasn't losing weight. Whatever you choose to do, I wish you all the best.

23456,"Nope, 2 years difference and 85lbs lost. I'm wearing everything but lipstick in the first picture",0
23457,"As far as advantage from a realistic standpoint (gains vs traditional weights) then I’d have to say “not really”. 

The cons for it is that the exact weights and your form are hard to track and control. It’s also limiting on variation. So in the long term doing that alone is not the best. 

However, that being said I wouldn’t say it’s worthless either. Exercise is always better than not. Also it is a great and fun way to mix things up. Doing unique and different workouts can be fun and keep things interesting vs boring. 

Has anyone built muscle and strength doing it? Have you seen the Highland Games? Of course you can.

So my summary would be:

Is it better? No. 

Is it worse? No. 

Is it good? As long as you’re doing it the right way, definitely. And if you mix it into your routine it’ll hopefully keep you motivated.",0

Carbohydrates and fats are used simultaneously whilst working out, so they are needed before working out. This way u have the energy required to do the workout.

Proteins after since protein is only needed to rebuild muscle fibre cells and repair damaged ones. Usually whilst your resting or sleeping, the muscle fibres will repair at its optimal rate, this is when large quantities of proteins can get used up. 

But it doesn’t matter when u take the protein shake, before or after workout since your body doesn’t ‘burn’ proteins, instead it stores it for later use.

I mostly use body weight exercises as a warmup or cool down now. For example I’ll do push ups and dips prior to the bench press or following it.

Instead I’ll simply say two things:

1 - There is no “perfect” exercise. Everyone has preferences and opinions and I get that this is yours... but it doesn’t validate it being 100% true. If you want a buff physique then neither running or swimming is best. They can help but there are better workouts. Each exercise/workout serves its purpose. 

2 - Running is not bad for your legs, joints or knees. (Improper technique and overwork is) And saying it makes you more likely to injure yourself so swimming “must” be better is like if I were to say running is better because I’m at a lower risk of drowning while running.",0

23583,"So I went through the same thing recently. Was 20-30 lbs from where I wanted to be, embarrassed to work out in front of others, and not super motivated. I started with little stuff i remembered from hs sports and gym. Every day i would find time to stretch, do things like leg raises (super easy) planks, squats, leg lifts, lots of easy, little exercises i could sit and do in front of the tv basically. But i could bump up my reps and add more ecercises and stretches, and it ultimately got me ready to take the next step and start really working out, and enjoying it. Now i walk regularly, work out a few times a week to p90x or yoga viedos, and i lost 30 lbs.",0
23586,great job and btw you were lovely before but now there must be a new number above 10 to describe you.,0
23587,Go to a gym and get a personal trainer. What do you hope to accomplish listening what’s most likely a fat sack of lazy potatoes typing away about what they don’t understand.,0
23588,"An important thing is that you find someway to exercise that you actually enjoy... or at least that you find the activity that is the less unpleasant for you. Exercise is not something you do for some months and then stop, it is something you will have to do for the rest of your life (though it is true, that once you become fit it would be more enjoyable).

By now, your first priority would be to improve your fitness and that means doing aerobic exercise. The mayor three options are swimming, biking and/or running. Walking is also a possibility, but it would require much more of your time (and so it can become boring and demotivating).

Running may be too demanding by now, but as I said before, it depends on what you like. Lots of people have successfully completed the [Couch to 5k](http://www.c25k.com/) program.

Probably the less challenging way to start exercising is using a static bike. Start by doing 20min, 3-4 days a week, with an easy setting. Progressively increase the time you are there until you total 3-4h per week. Also, as your legs get used to pedal, increase the resistance a bit. The static bike is really boring by itself, but you can do in front of the TV!

Also, for a lot of people, the best side of exercising is the social one. Getting with other people in a class is what makes the activity enjoyable. So, if that is your personality, you can enroll a swimming, spinning or dancing class, join a club for biking, hiking or running, whatever.

You don't have to stick to just one activity, doing always the same can also become pretty boring soon. You can, for instance, do the static bike two times per week, a dancing class once, and go hiking on the weekend.

Finally, don't limit your physical activity to the programmed exercise. Try to follow a more active lifestyle.",0
23589,Is there sports clubs or activities on offer at your campus? Or join the gym. Both good ways to interact with active people that you can gain some knowledge from.,0
23590,There is a YouTube channel called blogilates. The trainer is awesome and the workouts are fun. The workouts are free and perfect for beginners.,0
23591,"Don’t lose hope yet! How fast were you going? If it was 3.1 km 39 minutes would be about 4.5 kph which is barely a fast walk. So unless you were going that slow, it’s probably miles",0
23592,"Thank you. So, so much.",0
23594,"Sure, this won’t always be fun but it will be ultimately satisfying.  

Let’s start with increasing your daily steps...slowly. You are at 3k. At 6pm each evening, or any other convenient time, will you take 300 more steps each day for a week? Will you double it the next week each day, and keep doing that until you get to 12k a day? 

Once you get there you will be spending some time walking. You can do whatever you want during this time but you have to walk. Bring a bottle of water but follow the plan to it’s goal. 12k steps a day can be anywhere from 6 miles to 3 miles a day depending on how long your stride length is.

Once you get to 12k steps a day start measuring your cadence, how many steps are you taking a minute on average? Start your evening walk by measuring and then try to get your cadence to 75 steps per minute. Now keep 12k steps a day but increase your cadence each week by five steps per minute. Do not over do it. If you ever feel pain please stop and walk at a comfortable pace for another week and then start again.

When you get to 12k steps a day at 140 steps per minute then you will need another program but you will have made a ton of progress, will notice some differences and will be ready for your next step...and it only cost you about 90 min a day.

You can cheat, you can take another hundred steps here or there, park farther away, do steps in place, 12k is your goal, but you get there slowly and with patience and deep breaths.

You can do this, and I will answer if you have any questions.

So, yeah probably. 

On the mental health note, exercise absolutely *shreds* a good portion of the stuff I go to therapy for. I feel less anxious, less depressed, and my self destructive impulses disappear when I get consistent exercise.

23769,"Hey, congrats! Great achievement. If you are open to feedback, and I’ll assume you are - this number will be even higher when you work on form a bit more! You need to be driving more from your hammies and quads, half way thru the lift I can see you start to rely on your back to finish, two things, 1. The weight is pretty light for your back to finish 2. If you add more weight before fixing the form you’ll risk injury.

Drive thru the heel of your feet, thru your calf’s feeling engagement with your hammy and quads. It may be helpful to tilt your head to the ceiling, to practice, you can exaggerate by feeling your neck be taut, that’s too extreme but you’ll know how to decrease that once you feel it. 

Your posture thru the lift should have your back more perpendicular to the floor, as it is now, it’s closer to 45 degrees which allows for your back to engage and finish the lift for you. Again, it worked here, but you have the strength for more weight, but need to form to compliment it.",0

The movement in the video involves only glenohumeral extension, which is going to almost strictly target the lats, and have a negligible recruitment of the posterior delt.

It doesn't matter what you eat as long as you stay under TDEE-500 kcal.

23891,"Yes, it is possible- [have a look here](https://captaincalculator.com/health/calorie/calories-burned-walking-calculator/). Walking is one of the best activities you can do to burn extra calories. It doesn't take a lot of effort, it's low impact and every little bit you do adds up each day. I take several short walks during the day, the stairs when I can, park further away in parking lots. It makes a significant difference over days, weeks and months.

&gt; I remember gathering that a moderately intense resistance training session burns something like 500 - 800 calories 

That's likely too high of an estimate (unless you're doing some seriously intense circuit training or something similar and weigh a lot). [This article from Harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-of-leisure-and-routine-activities) has an estimate of about 133 calories per half hour for someone 185 lb. But keep in mind that weight training has some of the best EPOC (Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption) levels. Meaning that the body's rate of metabolism is effectively raised for a much longer period of time after your training session- more so than cardio, HIIT and others.",0

I would recommend eating slightly over your maintenance caloric intake while doing body weight exercises. Since you’re a beginner you’ll have newbie gains where you’ll gain muscle and lose fat. If you really wanna lose that little bit of body fat then do some h.i.i.t cardio. Last thing is don’t obsess over abs I did and it caused me to be small.

As a beginner start out with 12 reps 3 sets of each exercise. If you want to superset them, go for it. Start with body weight or TRX and up the weight over time. It wouldn’t hurt to also do leg lifts, hip thrusts, leg extensions and leg curls too. Google them if you don’t know them. 


If you do decide to do 100 squats and lunges a day just please, please, pleaseee stretch before and after. Doing excessive reps on the same muscle groups daily will result in strained muscles. It’s worth noting, if you train the same muscles the same way over and over again you’re asking for trouble. You’ll end up over-training those muscle groups (so don’t do it ***every*** day), plus your progress will quickly halt since your body will get used to those movements at that amount, so you’ll need to change it up in 3-5 weeks.",0

Immerse yourself in content until you feel good about your knowledge on the subject. Information is everywhere on the internet. You can google free programs, you can youtube exercise videos, learn technique, etc.   


I think some important things to note is related to muscle growth. Lift progressively heavier and heavier and your muscles will grow bigger and bigger. After exercising you should have protein (from food or shake). Make sure your body has the building blocks it needs (protein) to repair and grow the muscles you are working on. The bigger your muscles the faster your resting metabolism will get. The faster your resting metabolism the more calories you will burn throughout the day. So cardio is good and all but weight lifting will be better in the long run. I still do cardio but I think of it more as a secondary thing. Also know that if you train efficiently and consistently you are going to gain about 1-2 lbs of muscle per month. So it's a slow process.",0

If I don't get a good night's sleep, workouts the next day are a huge struggle.

23951,"As others have suggested, cardio is the best first step. Walking/light jogging. Speed doesn't matter at all at this point, what matters is distance here. Fitness trackers can help immensely, 8,000 - 10,000 steps a day goal should be something you strive to hit everyday with 1 individual longer walk/jog hitting 30-40 minutes 3 -4 times a week.

In terms of strength, not sure what exactly ""some weights"" means but if you have a bench and adjustable dumbbells this is a solid program to follow:  [https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/frankoman-dumbbell-only-split.html](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/frankoman-dumbbell-only-split.html)  However, don't alternate workouts this should be done in addition to the previous cardio suggestion not as an alternate. The first couple weeks will be brutal as your muscles will be sore and you will feel like hell adjusting to all the activity, but  if you just switched your diet, stick with it, and increase your physical activity you could drop 10 pounds in the first 2-3 weeks and then something around 1-3 pounds a week after.",0

23958,"Start with cardio. Even if it’s just waking right away, you can do intervals to gradually increase speed. Try to do at least half hour workouts at a time if you are able. So for example, if you need to start by walking 3mph, gradually start adding in intervals of 3.5mph. Eventually 3.5 will be your baseline and you can start adding in intervals of a higher speed until your jogging for a couple minutes at a time. 
With the weights, general recommendations are 2 days/week, 8 exercises hitting all major muscle groups, and 1-3 sets of 10. I would start with that and after getting more comfortable with exercise in general progress the weights from there.",0
23959,"I'll answer your question with a question if you don't mind (because the answer is in there more likely), why do you think my legs should be further apart?",0
23960,"I won’t be able to give technical information as well as others so I’ll just share what personally has helped me to not quit working out. 

Before university I had never been to a gym or done any exercising outside of physical activities like sports, or running. I started off with the treadmill since I obviously know how to walk/run. I would speed walk then after a lap I’d do stretches to catch my breath, if I felt comfortable I’d run at about 5.2-5.4 mph (that’s what was comfortable for me). Any time I felt like I needed a breather I would do stretches since in my mind it’s better to be doing something rather than nothing. 

It’s good you have stuff at home to work with, looking up google images or YouTubing exercises you can do with the things you have are a great option. I would just kinda replicate what I saw people at the gym doing. 

I also motivated myself by tracking my heart rate. It was super grounding and gave me motivation to keep it up at a good level for me. To find your “fat burning zone” take 220, subtract your age, then multiply by 0.7. For example for me, 220-22= 198*0.7 = 138.6. 

The most important thing is that this is for you! You’re amazing, strong, and awesome for wanting to improve yourself how you think you should!",0

23968,When you’re ready to lift make sure you eat the right amount of protein! I think it’s 1g per lb (your weight at that time). just focus on a small (at most) 20% calorie deficit. 15 or 10 is fine to start with. It may take a while to figure out what works for you and keeps you motivated. Just be healthy about it and lose gradually. That way you’re less likely to gain it all back. And yes don’t worry about these “fad diets”. Honestly all of them work the same way— small caloric deficit = fat loss. I also track how many calories I burn with a watch that helps too.,0

23976,"Having a healthy body starts in the kitchen with good nutrition .    If you eat crap you can’t make up for it with exercise.   Start by tracking everything you eat to get an idea of what you really are eating.   Once you determine that start removing as much sugar as you can and drop the highly refined carbs ( ie white breads).    Add in healthy snacks like veggies and fruits , and healthy proteins.    Then once you have your foods in better order find an exercise program that works for you that you can stick with over time.   At least 30 mins x 3 days per week is a decent start.  In 6 months take another look at where you are and adjust accordingly.    You need lifetime changes to your habits , not a diet or fad program.   Along the way read up on bmr, macro nutrients, and calorie counting.  Implement that data into your routine when it makes sense to you.",0
23977,Also to add make a run a timed run. So instead of worrying about distance set a time limit of 40 minutes and run the whole time.,0
23978,"My suggestion. Increase your overall mileage. I would say make 2 runs 2-2.5 miles. 1 run a speed work run, tempo run, sprints, uphill Sprints, that could be 1.5 miles total of you want. Then another run a long slow distance. For 4 miles. And I mean slow. I can average a 8-8:30 pace. On Long slow distance runs I'm around 9:45-10:30 pace. 

Believe it or not. Running slow will make you faster. If you run 1.5 fast all the time you will never increase speed.

Rule of thumb also is to never increase mileage more than 10% a week.",0

When I get free drinks at gigs, I skip the alcohol and opt for water. If I feel fancy I'll get cranberry juice and seltzer. Once in a while I'll have alcohol, but that's on a weekend when I don't have anything planned in the morning.

If I'm dancing hard, I go to my hot yoga class beforehand. After I get home I stretch a bit. I also regularly go to pilates. All this is done to prevent injuries.

Sometimes when I gig at restaurants I get free food. I used to order the most expensive meal on the menu because I could, but then I noticed I was gaining weight. Now I stick to salads with complex carbs and protein. But most of the time I bring my own food or eat a balanced meal before I show up to the gig.

Notice that it's all about prioritizing essentials: staying hydrated, eating well, getting sleep, staying in shape and making use of blocks of time. So in your case, if you drink, maybe have one less drink. Or make sure one of your drinks is water – and drink a ton of it! You can try putting an alarm on your phone to head home one hour earlier. Or make sure you have food prepared at home instead of going to the usual greasy spoon for drunk food. Or maybe it's staying home just one or two nights a week. Whatever you do, make sure it works for you!",0
24015,"As a fellow redditor that has lost a lot of weight this year and feeling great, previous redditor is absolutely right in walking more, etc. However, it's diet the most important element in weight loss. Making small changes in your diet and as you lose the weight you will be motivated to make more changes... Drink more water, ex: cut the soft drinks or alcohol or carbs, eat more vegetables. I use an app where I log my food intake and it makes me accountable when I overeat, and keep my calories on point etc. Anyways, eating well and combining it with exercise is the perfect recipe. Good luck on your journey, hope you find what works for you!!",0
24018,"I agree with the people recommending Bret Contreras. In addition to him, I would highly recommend Whitney Simmons and Hanna Öberg. They have a bunch of glute activation and exercise videos.

More importantly, I don't think this has been mentioned yet, but what you eat is going to be a huge factor as well. I don't know what your current nutrition or the amount of exercise you do right now. But just as an example, assume you're not working out at all right now. Then you start lifting and doing all of these recommended exercises. However, you continue to eat the same amount of food as you were before, you'll eventually lose weight and potentially get a smaller booty.

In order to gain mass, not only will you eventually want to lift heavier, but you'll want to eat more (specifically more protein).",0
24019,"Walk, and walk often.  Once you have gotten better at it carry something, anything, and just keep adding more weight or more distance ( or walk faster).  Skip the running unless you want to look like a runner.   Weighted carries works the entire body , especially the core.",0
24020,"I’d try for more sleep too. Your body needs that time to recover otherwise you’ll suffer in performance the next day. 8 hours of sleep is the goal to aim for. Obviously everyone is different however if you’re dragging in the morning generally it’ll be due to more sleep being the need your body is asking for. 

I admittedly get around 6.5 hours a night but I do try for more on the weekends though I hardly ever get more than 7. I wake at about 4:30 am to get ready for whatever workout I have planned and prep my stuff the night before so I can ease into the morning. 

If you are newly starting this routine you’ll have to have that time you need to adjust to it but based off your plan I’d say going to bed earlier is the answer and then adjust it over time as you get used to it.",0
24021,This. My rec is to get to bed earlier. Strikes me as likely you're not getting enough sleep.,0
24023,"Lack of sleep will 100% harm your personal wellness. Some people have different sleep requirements--one person could need only 5-6 hours a night while another needs 8-9 to function properly. So it's best to listen to your body. Generally, if you want the best of both worlds (night life and early rising for exercise), you'll probably notice that your workouts will get less effective and your overall health will decrease. Not to mention how clubbing involves alcohol consumption, typically, which isn't a healthy thing to do multiple times a week... Be careful out there.",0
24024,"I'd start with weight lifting. It doesn't require much stamina. Just do how ever many reps as you want and take as many breaks as you want. After a month or two you will have built up a good amount of strength. Now when you start  working on stamina by working on cardio and endurance training, you have a good base.

24033,"Personally, If I want to sleep earlier and wake up earlier, I will just do something to make me sleep super early the night before (like 6 or 7) to guarantee I'm getting enough sleep. Like melatonin or something. This might cause you to wake up unexpectedly at around 10 or 11 but just try and go back to sleep, should be easier after napping a couple hours.",0

24035,"Those people getting up early for workout but staying till midnight are dumb as shit and hurting themselves in a long run.

There is also no point in starting your day super early if it doesn't fit your schedule, you are either waking up at 5am and going to bed at 9pm or you go to sleep late and wake up later.

Also by waking up early you are just rebalancing your hours and gaining no net positive unless you must be up at that time for work or whatever.",0
24036,Very good tips man. I'm gonna try the coffee and cold shower. Probably wake up at 5. I appreciate the response!,0
24037,"Can’t say this is what will work for you. I wake up at 4am to hit the gym by 5:10-5:30. This allows me time for a shower (sometimes cold) to wake me up, coffee, and breakfast. My exercise routine consists of a short moderate to high intensity cardio warmup followed by barbell training and applicable accessory lifts.

I try to make sure I’m in bed no later than 10pm at the latest though I usually shoot for 9pm. The night before, I program the coffee maker to have coffee ready for me when I wake up. Usually the smell of coffee by itself will get me going and once I grab a cup, I feel even more awake. It also helps to have an alarm that you actually have to get out of bed to turn off. I wasn’t naturally a morning person but when my wife and I had our son toward the beginning of last year, it forced me to change up my routine so I could make sure I get my daily exercise in. I’m not sure how long you’ve done exercise in the early morning hours but I say just stick with it. You’ll get used to it in time. 

Oh, and if you don’t already do so, make sure your clothing and stuff for your day is already laid out. It streamlines the morning, and plus, while you’re shaking off the groggies, you don’t have to think so much about where everything is.",0

24049,"While even after watching your video I still have 0 clue what kinda butt shape you have, I would HIGHLY suggest you stop breaking down your body parts into exact categories. Reality is that you are more than likely to be a part of two or more as far as underlying structure goes anyways. Big butt on a skinny/big girl is different than a small butt on a skinny/big girl. Then you have genetics that are billions of combination.

Point being: Stop focusing on the small details. Want a bigger butt? Do more exercises for your legs. Focusing just on butt is hard, your muscles are all connected somehow. Want a thinner butt, start losing weight and you'll eventually lose mass there too.

The moment you start to think of BODY improvement instead of body-Part improvement, you'll find that making progress becomes Much much easier.

Strength training: you'll start to lose strength after around 3 weeks. Closer to 4 weeks if you are an advanced lifter.

Cardio: you'll start to see a drop in performance after just a couple of days. Probably a little more if you are an athlete. A study of athletes found that performance had dropped up to 25 % after 3-4 weeks without training. 

As a general rule, you'll become ""out of shape"" faster if you're talking cardio compared to if you're talking strength training.

First we do a pushup (triceps), swing, then a clean (the one you asked about), squat, and press.

This is all done with two heavy kettlebells and advanced. It's a really awesome way to train but kettlebells have a high learning curve, well worth the investment.

As for the other question, the clean and rack is pretty technical to explain in one post, but nothing hurts if you do it right and the weight is distributed correctly. 

For anyone interested I'd highly recommended looking into the assisted dead clean which we designed to train/drill the clean progression, racking, opening up of the hand and insert.

24148,"Eat more, and eat more every. single. day. Watch some competitive eating. After you have eaten you'll feel awfully full for 10-15 minutes, sometimes hours. You gotta eat all around the clock too. Eat before bed. Eat right when you get up. If you're stomach ain't full it's not doing you any good! It's not just daily intake, it's more like your 3-day running average. Don't miss a day. It took me 6 months of dedication to gain 15 lbs. That was 10 years ago, and I've lost about half of that eating normally since then.

Oatmeal, butter, milk, nuts, eggs, whatever you can eat a ton of. Protein powder and ice cream. 

You gotta work out too. You have to push yourself. Tell your body it's not strong enough to do what you are trying to make it do and it has to go anabolic. In general your body hates to change anything and likes right where it is. Being very active is great but doesn't convince your body to change. Squats are king. Deadlifts are cool too but absolutely have a spotter who knows proper form...back pain for years = not worth it.",0

24150,"Congratulations on getting to the gym to kill it and on your progress!!!  I worked out for two years pretty regularly doing mostly cardio, and some machines.....  the lack of results were really discouraging.  I finally decided to suck it up and spend a little money on a personal trainer.  That was a game changer!!! I highly recommend working with a trainer and letting them know your goals.  My trainer trained me to train myself which has built up my body and my confidence in utilizing the full gym.  Even getting a trainer for a month could be a huge help.  Good luck!  

Also, my fav back exercises: 
Superset lat pulldown with row: these can be mixed up too, by changing the bars and grips to target different areas of the back.  
Standing rows are cool.  Where the cable is low and you pull in towards your underboob, one arm at a time, this will target under the bra strap area.
Try standing barbell rows as well.  
And hyperextentions, this focuses on the top butt and lower back.  Only use your body weight and go slow and hold at the top for a couple seconds.

Try to do five sets of each 8-12 reps each set.  Don't just focus on your pull, be deliberate in the release too, go slow.  Keep your abs contracted in everything you do at the gym.  This will protect your back.  During your workouts focus on pulling with your back and not your arms.

Hopefully this helps!",0

Exercises have great health benefits but minimal effect on weight loss acutely relative to diet. Over time though your increased muscle mass does increase your basal metabolic rate. For me it took about 12 weeks of 4 workouts a week to notice an obvooys increase in muscle size but when I did I also noticed a positive feedback loop where fat loss accelerated for the next few months.

The exercise is helpful but there are a lot of other exercises that will do basically the exact same thing without requiring the equipment.",0
24176,"Go get a really good pair of shoes for yourself from a shoe store that specialises in fitting customers if you're serious about running,  They should put you on a treadmill to watch you run. Also recommend a good cotton shirt due to sweat absorption and good socks to avoid blistering. 

Should also carry some water or drink to replenish your sweat, personally I use 200ml cranberry juice mixed with 500ml water and added some sea salt to replenish electrolytes but water is generally sufficient.

Can jog outside or on a treadmill, just depends on what your situation is, ideally softer ground to avoid wear and tear on your joints",0
24177,"Ofcourse you can continue to do cardio, will just take a bit longer to make the 'gains' you desire, just because your body makes the exercise more effective doesn't negate the exercise, you're still going to be burning calories. You'll be surprised with weight training, most people who start out with cardio and transition to weights end up liking weights a lot more, based on experience i've had with people anyways. 

Can also increase the incline on the cardio, run/walk/jog with a weighted backpack, run/walk/jog with weights in your hand, make use of the assault bike ect.

Just try not to be intimidated by weights, it will benefit you in the long run.",0

It’s sad to see cardio isn’t the best for me because it’s the only part of my workout that I look forward to :( but I will definitely work on incorporating new exercises, some of which I am familiar with. Of course I’ll continue a little running cardio just to make me not dread the gym, but I’ll increase the amount of weighted activities/compound movements and see how that effects my back in a few months. Thanks again!",0
24179,"Hey,

So i've had a similar issue although with stomach fat (25M), been actively training 4-5x a week for 14 months and only now is it reducing, just happens to be the last place where i've lost weight, body is magical eh.. From reading your responses in this thread it appears you prefer cardio, the issue with this is that it's hard to 'progressively overload' on cardio which means that your body becomes accustomed to the cardio that you're doing, finds ways to make the cardio more efficient and thus becomes less effective. This is one of the primary reasons as to why weight training is easier to do to lose weight. 

If I do 6 reps at a weight today, I can do 7 reps the next time and i've progressed in the training, eventually I can increase the weight. With cardio, you either have to increase your time or run longer which can spiral out of control easier. My recommendation is to mix both cardio and weight training so your body gets a 'shock' to the system and will help you burn fat easier.  Hope this helps.

'But thank you for the suggestion on the deadlift' The deadlift is an extremely difficult exercise, as it's one of the harder compound movements. It is very technical and if you've not completed a deadlift before I highly recommend getting assistance if you're going to try it. Some back isolation exercises that are a lot simpler to complete are the likes of a 'lat pulldown', negative pullups with a band for assistance, dumb bell rows. To increase your heart rate from compound movements, there's squats, deadlifts, bench, overhead press(very technical use light weight), lunges/side lunges and prowler pushes. 

I cannot really comment on the diet as I only know what works for me but try to consume protein on days you work out.

Hope this helps",0

If you have a chair you can do chair dips for your triceps, and if you get to chairs together facing away from each other you can do regular dips if they’re tall enough. You can also look to invest in some resistance bands, they will open up a whole new world of workouts, you can also invest in an ab wheel for obviously ab workouts, there are also push up variations like the diamond pushup (more advanced tho) or the incline and decline pushups (target different areas of the chest) Id say for now your best bet is doing reverse push ups and reverse chin ups and reverse pull ups (reverse meaning starting from where you usually end you can cheat to get there, and then slowly doing the exercise in reverse) Big rant so im sorry if its sloppy writing

Once you have a starting point of your TDEE (how much you burn per day), subtract 500 calories from that; the result should be your guideline of how much to eat each day max. Make sure you get lots of protein as it helps maintain your muscle mass (and since you seem to be a beginner, you may even gain muscles while losing fat in the beginning). Evaluate your caloric intake and weight loss every few weeks and adjust as necessary (also, your TDEE will go down as you lose weight, so figure that in too).

With a mix of strength training and cardio, you're off to a good start workout-wise.",0

Grippers, sometimes called hand grippers, are primarily used for testing and increasing the strength of the hands; this specific form of grip strength has been called crushing grip, which has been defined as meaning the prime movers are the four fingers, rather than the thumb.There are differences from brand to brand, but the common features of standard grippers are that they use a torsion spring fitted with two handles.  The exact dimensions of these elements vary, as well as the materials used to make them; the springs are made from various types of steel, and the handles are generally made from wood, plastic, steel or aluminum.

24252,"My answer below is very generalized as I'm assuming you're newer to working out. It is very basic advice, so what I suggest above all is if you're serious about getting better and more athletic, consider going to a personal trainer or at the very least watching YouTube videos on how to do the following exercises.

Work your core and legs. Do planks, crunches, leg raises, bird-dog, supermans, bridges, wood choppers, and russian twists for core. 10 reps for those exercises, for planks you want to aim for roughly 30-45 second holds. You don't have to do them all in the same day, in fact you shouldn't, but spread them out throughout the week.

For legs do variations of squats and deadlifts. If you're newer to lifting, keep it in the 10-15 rep range for those exercises. Focus on form above all else, not weight. You shouldn't have crappy form on the last rep of a set; it should be difficult, but your form should be the same as it was for rep #1. 

Single leg exercises are awesome for sports. So try to mix those in as often as you can. Bulgarian split squats, shrimp squats, pistol squats, lunges, single leg romanian deadlifts, single leg fitness ball curls are all incredible exercises for any athlete. 

As for your vertical, all of the above will be useful but more explosive movements will help a ton. Power cleans and box jumps are the most basic movements that will improve your explosiveness. They are basic but I recommend them because they work. For cleans it is very very very important that you master the form before you do heavier weight. Seriously. You can really hurt yourself doing any Olympic movement like a clean or snatch. 

Box jumps or any plyometric movement that is similar should be performed sparingly, ie. do them at low reps with high intensity. These are not meant to be done every day. Twice a week, preferably once a week. Plyometrics are tough on the joints.

Since this is basketball you're training for, cardio is king and in my opinion is more important than all of the above. Run, run, run. Use a skipping rope. Run hills. Bike. Hell, swim if you can. It's an endurance sport as much as it an explosive sport; it doesn't matter how much you can squat or how high you can jump when you need to play good defense or run the floor in the 4th quarter.

Again this is all basic stuff but covers pretty much all of your bases if you want to jump higher and become a better athlete. Don't neglect your upper body as well, specifically your shoulders.

Oh yeah, and try and play basketball as much as you can. Nothing beats actually playing the sport you're training for.",0
24253,"You want to hold it with the spring side up. Hold it so the end of the bar is kinda “tucked” in under your thumb on the palm of your hand. Squeeze using your fingers and thumb. You should squeeze at a steady pace. Not fast or slow just do what feels natural to you. I use mine for maybe 20-30 minutes combined between both hands, 3-4 times a week. Pretty much whenever I’m watching tv on the couch or in my bedroom laying in bed, if I’m bored etc. 
Don’t squeeze too hard if it’s too strong for you. You can still use grip strengtheners if they are too strong. Don’t force it though, build up to it going full force or you could possibly hurt yourself. indications that you may be using it improperly are throbbing pain in your wrist or hand.

24295,"Your body is like a machine, when you are inactive sitting at a computer or reading a book or whatever, there's a lot of things that are off, you are in like a power saving mode. When you exercise all these systems turn on. So the golden hour after exercising is like, your body wants to go back into power saving mode, and it's like... we got work to do so we are ready for the next time we come out of power saving mode. We gotta recharge these batteries, we gotta top up the gas and oil.  


When you exercise, you are damaging your muscles, and your muscles need protein to repair (among other things). So it's good to have a diet that has a decent amount of protein in it. You want the protein needed for repair to already be in your system (because you are eating protein regularly). It's also good to have a protein shake after exercising so you are topping up how much protein is available for repair. And protein shakes, because its liquid it absorbs quickly, and its pretty much just protein, so your body will have what it needs (and it pees out what it doesn't need). If you don't top it up your body is going to do a half ass job of repairing because it doesn't have the materials on hand.  


In this process of damaging and repairing your body will basically think - when I repair it, I should repair it to be larger than before so it can more easily do the work next time. So yes, make sure your body has all the nutrients it needs, by eating healthy generally speaking, and especially protein, so that during the golden hour after exercising it has everything it needs to repair and grow your muscles. It also repairs during sleep, so make sure you get enough sleep.",0

Basically, you should eat a percentage of your body weight in grams daily to make optimal gains. Unfortunately, there is no ""1"" percentage. What works best for me might not work best for you or your workout style.

I have, however, read that working out right before bed can be disruptive to sleep. There are some people who state that you should workout in the morning because it is supposed to raise your metabolism for the day, however I have not read an actual study with that information. Common sense says it is correct (imo) because your muscles will need to work harder to do the same movements after a workout.

I feel it would be easier for me to just abstain from eating anything else for one day and stay at my current level the rest of the days, than to cut down calories on all days. Of course, the shake day would not be a gym day (just seems like a bad idea to work out with such a big deficit for the day).

I don't know how reliable body analysis scales are - haven't used them much. 

And regarding the TDEE, I really know where you're coming from. It is difficult to lose weight but even more so for us shorter girls, who have to eat close to nothing in order to lose ½ kg pr week. Sucks. 
When cutting, I find that it helps if I ""save up"" calories during the day and eat a big meal 2-3 hours before bed. That way I can go to bed feeling satiated and I can fit in some sweets once in while. For example if you do 1200 kcal: breakfast: 200 kcal (could be oats with water and a bit of skyr/greek yoghurt), lunch: 250 kcal (could be a salad with chicken breast/cottage cheese), afternoon snack: 150 kcal (could be cottage cheese and fruit/vegetable) and late dinner: 600 kcal (could be a loooot of vegetables, chicken breast or omelette and maybe a little bit of chocolate or whatever you find yourself craving during diets).

Regarding the cost of protein, cheaper options are eggs, low fat greek yoghurt, cottage cheese or skyr (if you have that where you live). 200 grams of low fat cottage cheese is around 138 calories, 24 grams of protein.

24364,"If it feels like it’s close to giving out, then you’re certainly working hard enough! And don’t worry too much about not sweating since, not all of us sweat as much or as easily as others. And that sounds like a good plan! I’m sure you’ll do great and I mean, if it’s more intense then it’ll work just as good. A short intense workout is just as good as a longer, less intense one!",0
24365,Thanks for the tips.  Not sure if I'm breaking a sweat from it.  I do it for 10 minutes which is about when my body feels close to giving out.  My goal is to 10 minutes ever two hours six times a day.  Would it be better if I did 5 minutes at a time if there was more intensity?,0
24366,"You could try Pilates as an option as well as outdoor walking but walking side to side/moving around while walking would be beneficial too, in my opinion. 

You’re best off doing low impact cardio if you suffer with knee problems, since it’ll affect your knees least. Low impact circuit training, low impact pilates and just walking would be good for you, I’ll warn that running isn’t the best for your knees. As long as you’re getting your heart rate up and breaking a sweat then you should be good!

I know you said that you’re limited to working out at your home, but if you do have a swimming pool nearby and are able to go to it then I would consider that for future reference since swimming is an amazing workout. Good luck!",0

24370,"Hey, good question. 

If your natural inclination is to want to do HIIT, or that's been an effective form for you in the past and you don't have any major structural damage I'd sprint. 

The thing with sprinting is you don't even need to work more than you rest like HIIT. If you're going all out intensity with each sprint, you'll still greatly benefit. 

And your joints will thank you. If you're sprinting correctly you have a slight forward lean which doesn't affect the joints as much as jogging, where you're more prone to stack your joints vertically. 

It's also a skill that I believe will greatly help in this, what did you say it was, zombie apocalypse? It's not always about how long you can run to survive, but how much separation you can get between you and the zombies.",0

24376,"Reverse push ups where you start at the top and go down as slowly as you can and repeat. Pushups work a lot of things but chest is the biggest muscle it should be working if you’re doing a standard pushup properly, along with arms and abs worked as well. So you could do bench press, chest flys, and then arm workouts like curls, tricep extensions, and shoulder workouts, basically anything that works chest core or arms. But the best thing in my opinion if you want to be able to do a push up as fast as you can, try the reverse pushup or a push up but where you’re hands are flat on something slightly elevated like a chair or step, these two things make the pushup easier while still working generally the same muscles (elevated or incline pushup works slightly more lower chest. Also try decline pushups for upper chest however this workout is harder than the standard pushup) but both will strengthen muscles helping for regular pushups and other pushup variations.",0

It wasn’t euphoric in the same way that drugs induce euphoria (not speaking from experience lol) but it was definitely addicting in the sense that I knew I could go farther than I’d thought was possible.

24399,"That is great you tried it out! I'm very proud of you!

A before/after shot sounds very inspiring. You should do it if you feel it would be motivating for you.

Please remember to rest your muscles. I dont know how hard you worked your muscles today. If you start feeling sore tomorrow, that is natural. Pay attention to how sore you are. If it hurts too much to move, you may have overdid it this morning. If that is the case you can try less repetitions, less weight, or a combination of the two.

If you do feel sore and it is not that bad, more like a minor annoyance as you go about your day, it means you did well. You worked your body an optimal amount so that you will gain muscle (with continued exercising). Others may have different points of view on how often you should workout, but I would recommend placing a day in between workouts. Ex. Saturday workout, Sunday rest, Monday workout, Tuesday rest, etc.

24402,"Everyone has different motivation for exercise. A good way to start is to listen to your favorite music, podcast, or audiobook. This will sort of distract you while you get used to exercise. 

PE, swimming, and running are all cardio intensive. Maybe you don’t dislike exercise, you just dislike cardio? 

I have four different exercise days: push day, pull day, leg day, and core and cardio. 

Push day is chest, triceps, and shoulders 
Pull day is back and biceps 
Legs are...you get it 
My favorite cardio to do is jump rope 

Look up “push day exercises” and you’ll get a bunch of options

Last thing, if you want to maintain exercise and not see it as a chore, you need a goal. If you don’t know what yours is, spend some time in thought to find your answer. Mine is simple; take care of yourself so no else has to.

You might check out some pilates that focuses on legs. There is a move called tabletop that might be useful for you. That works your core most, but other leg exercises/stretches during pilates can be very helpful and low stress.

24503,"Ask A Doctor!!! You have an underlying heart condition and most people don't, so most people can't tell you much about if you just need to hydrate more or if you need to Chill Out Or Die.

I'm gonna assume that you're sweating your ass off in these classes (which sound fun as hell btw there's no krav maga where I live and I'm JEALOUS) so there's two things that *anybody* would need to do, heart condition or no.

1) Hydrate. Drink water during class, drink water before class, drink water after class. Drink so much goddamn water. The American CDC says you should get 3-4 liters of water per day (from food and drinking fluids together), plus more if you're exercising and/or it's hot outside. 

2) Get those electrolytes. Make sure you're getting enough sodium and potassium, because those are the minerals that carry electrical charges from your nerves to move your muscles. You sweat them out along with water, so you need to restock on them in addition to rehydrating, or else you'll throw your cells all out of whack and make yourself sick. Crackers, bananas, and Gatorade are your friends.

I started gym researching diet &amp; working out

Ive lost over 10kgs (22lbs) in 1 month

For me, when I first got serious post-back surgery, it was walking on the treadmill for 45–60 minutes a day at a 15° incline. Now I’m doing more weightlifting, but if I had started there, I would have quit early.

Maybe most key, don’t skip a day just because you don’t feel like it. Fitness and weight loss is like saving money by dropping your spare change into a jar every evening.

Just keep showing up. Even if you're tired and dont feel up to it. Your coach wi help warm you up/ease into it. After warm up you'll be ready. 

Side note, people are intimidated by crossfit but I personally think it's one of the best things for couch potatoes to do because you get so much help and everything can be scaled. I usually have to cut back running distances, I do ring rows instead of pull ups, elevated push ups instead of floor pushups, I use the light technique bar, air squats instead of wall balls etc. I've been doing it since May and can't believe how much stronger I'm getting!!!

24563,"A lot of your questions have some overlap so I’ll do my best to answer as fully as I can. 

Yes spacing will matter, but it depends on your training schedule and the type of training you do. So, I’ll broadly go over split resistance training and full body resistance. I don’t believe one is better than the other though they each have their benefits. 

Split:
You’ll break your strength training into 2-3 workouts usually. Common examples would be upper one day and lower the next or back/shoulders/abs, legs/biceps, chest/triceps/abs. Splitting does allow greater strength focus and easier recovery since you can hit your back really hard and have a full week to recovery. Additionally, I’ve found I’m a bit fresher throughout workouts in this manner cause pull-ups don’t directly work your biceps, but do tax them enough to make something like curls a bit tougher. You can start 3 days a week with this setup with a days rest between workouts and see solid progress over time and if you’re serious in a year or two you could slowly ramp up to 5-6 days and recycle the rotation 2x a week if you really felt like it. 

Full body:
This type of training focuses on the entire body. So, you might pick 1-2 exercises only per body part and do 3 sets. This type of training would be done 2 times a week spread out by about 3 days. This is ideal if you’re looking to be a bit more athletic. It requires less time per week as to allow you to devote more of your time to other goals you may have. The strength gains you see here will be more gradual than those seen with split training as the frequency will be more distant. That said, you have the option to budget your time toward other areas much more easily. 

In summary, neither is better than the other. They both have unique benefits. Split training is nice for pure muscle building and full body is better for multifaceted needs as an athlete. I personally follow a full body resistance program because I’m not looking to be a strength athlete and I have other conditioning goals as well. Best of luck. Sorry for the long winded response.",0
24565,"I tried and fail over and over, spent all of my 20s obese.
When I was 29 I ended up having back surgery.  That was my wake up call. After months of recovery, I went and signed up for CrossFit. I need to be told what to do and when to do it and I knew the gym wasn’t my answer.
I enjoy CF because it’s a family. And we keep each other accountable. So when I miss a few days, I’m asked where I was and if everything’s ok. And with my back, I can’t do a lot of the exercises. But trainers are able to modify any workout they give you. So even starting, you’ll take baby steps to doing pull ups, with no judgement, because we’ve all been that new person.
With food, I set realistic goals, changed one thing every week. I quit trying to find a quick fix and I quit trying fad diets. Changing it from “diet” to “life style” made a difference.  Weird, but whatever I could do that worked, I did. I cut out processed foods and eating out. Drank eater and kept track of it. Ate foods with minimal ingredients. Didn’t eat anything I couldn’t pronounce.
And I didn’t give up.  If I had a meal or snack I knew wasn’t too great, I acknowledged it, and the next meal tried to do better. I quit letting it ruin my day and saying “I’ll try again tomorrow”.

Let’s face it, 99% of girls don’t want to be with a scrawny dweeb. I decided to start using social media less, eat more, and go to the gym 4 times a week. It was difficult at first, but my body is getting used to it.

It’ll be dependent on your goals and you can kinda set your own. If you’re goal is weight loss, then 2 full body strength workouts will help you build a little muscle, but primarily make sure most of the weight lost is fat so I think that’s a good place to start. If you want to get stronger/build muscle, then start with 2 and work your way to 3-4 strength training days a week over the course of a few months. Best of luck",0

24588,"Exercise is really good for anxiety. When you’re experiencing anxiety, your amygdala is sending messages to your body saying “I am in danger”. This was great when we were running from tigers, but now we get this message for everyday stressors, like when our taxes are due. Exercise is healthy way to cope with the symptoms of anxiety as it allows you to get out some of that adrenaline from the amygdala.",0

24593,"It seems like you’re erector muscles and some of your supporting back muscles need strengthening. Instead of focusing purely on the abs, train your entire core including your back and obliques. Having imbalances is likely what causes you’re lower back discomfort. The ab exercises you listed are great. Other ab exercises include bicycles, V-ups, L-sits, and ab wheel rollouts just to name some of my favorites. L-sits are particularly good as they don’t stress the lower back much and really strengthen your posterior chain. Some exercises that I think would help your lower back are Supermans on the floor, good-mornings, and reverse leg lifts. A reverse leg lift is done by laying your chest on a chair or table and lifting your legs out straight from hanging. I found this really helped strengthen my lower back for hanging leg raises. Best of luck",0
24594,"As many people have said already, weight loss is mostly about diet. I think bodyweight exercise would be ideal since you have such a packed schedule. You could do circuits with a few exercises and play with the time or rep range. You can get a quality workout in 15 minutes or less if you’re really strapped for time. 100 burpees is a great challenge and time effective. Maybe it takes you 15 minutes or so the first time, but you can easily bring it within 10 minutes and below 6 if you’re serious.",0

I ended up starting out at a jog (5mph or so) and then gradually going 1/4 mile, 1/2 mile, etc until I could go for several miles and then I began running at higher speeds over time and then increasing distance again.

24629,You don’t only have to run. Lifting weights can help with speed and endurance as well. You can lift lighter weights for more reps as well as super setting exercises to get your heart pumping. Lifting weights will also help with speed as well. Quick tip as well. Don’t be afraid or feel unworthy when you first start lifting weights. A lot of people that I have come across don’t want to lift because they can’t lift that much so they are insecure. What people don’t realize is that everyone starts out at the same level. It’s just others have started a little before others and that’s ok. You will get stronger and better with time and soon enough you will fit right in. Good luck with your goals!!,0
24630,"Keep going! Try doing different types of exercises boost endurance such as rowing or spinning. Start with 15 then work your way up
To 45 minutes each time!",0
24631,"From the book - the 4 hour body, the slow carb diet is a good way to lose weight. It's basically no sugar (not even from fruits), low carb, and add beans to every meal. Beans are high in protein and fiber. It's the fiber that helps you feel full longer. One cheat day a week, you can have all the greasiest, high carb, disgusting food you want, and that is when you can have fruits.  r/slowcarb for more information.   
If you really must have alcohol you can have a very dry red wine. It will slow your results but it's your best option if you have to.  
If you don't fully do the slow carb diet, it is recommended that you at least have a breakfast with 30g of protein (not a protein shake), it has to be real food. You can still have a protein shake later in the day, if you are working out a lot, protein is a great way to help recovery and build muscle.  
Compound exercises are the best way to get results, while keeping it relatively simple. So you can get a full body workout with only a few exercises. Like the 3 powerlifting moves - bench, deadlift, and squat.  
It's probably best for limited space to get dumbbells instead of a barbell (also safer when you don't have a spotter). You could probably find a bench that can fold away and go under your bed or into your closet easily. Selectable weight dumbbells are nice for changing weights quicker and taking up less space, but they are more expensive.  
Building strength is the best way to start your exercise journey, eventually you should work towards being a better athlete by working on endurance. By doing more cardio and really high rep workouts.",0
24632,"I feel relieved, on my first week of my journey, I lost 10kg, on my second week I lost 3kg. Now all I lose is 0.5kg...",0
24633,"Your schedule makes this tough, but you might want to check out r/bodyweightfitness. They have good recommendations for working out in small spaces.

For losing weight, here’s a one thing that has helped me work on a good calorie deficit—sautéed vegetables. I hate raw veggies, but I can eat sautéed stuff all day. Meal prep that stuff and use an app like My Fitness Pal to track your calories. I’ve lost about 25 pounds using it.",0

24641,15 to 30 minutes of going to the sauna four to five times a week is shown to increase stamina by up to 20%.,0
24642,How fast you are is in direct correlation with how much force your feet hit the ground while running. I’m not saying go out there and just stomp around. But you have to use the springy-ness of your joints to help propel you. That’s why after 35 runners times start going down-our joints start stiffening up. So if you wanna run you better do it sooner rather than later!,0
24643,Awesome thanks a bunch really,0
24644,"This is where I would start you. First, because you want to lose weight you need to find your calorie maintenance level (the amount of calories you need to eat each day to maintain your current weight). 
Use this calculator https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html

500 calories less then your maintenance level each day is equal to a pound loss each week (3500). I would recommend losing only 1 to the most 2 lbs each week.
This is how you are going to lose the weight. 

Second. Try your best to eat clean and unprocessed foods. They will keep you fuller longer and help maintain healthy body functions.

Third. Do resistance training, this will help marginally to lose weight but it will more importantly build muscle and make you look better then just losing weight by itself. 
To start basic body workouts like push ups and sit ups will go a long way. 
If you are willing to put in a little cash, you can easily target all your muscle groups using dumbell exercises. 

Fourth. Be consistent. It's a long process but it will make you feel a lot better about yourself when you hit your goals and even during the process in between. Shortcuts get you bad results. Hardwork will make you look amazing. 

Dont overwork yourself, give yourself rest when you need it.

But dont cheat yourself out of progress by being lazy. 
Good luck, and I really hope you hit your goals!",0
24645,I see so is there any particular diet I should follow? And possibly any exercise maybe that I can do that isn't too major but that could help?,0
24646,"Losing weight is mostly just going to come from cleaning up your diet and being in a scalp deficit. Of course exercise can help make it a little quicker. But unless you pump out hours of cardio a day to burn calories, it's not gonna give you the same weight loss results as dieting",0

24656,Don't buy anything to exercise. You can exercise using things you already have or go to a park and use the equipment there. When you buy something and you don't use it it reminds you that you failed. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life. Just start working out. Do something fun like riding a bike. Making progress will keep you going. Then when you are into a routine you can buy equipment to fine tune your workout.,0

So that’s why I added in the body exercises. I just wanted to be sure I was being well rounded in my exercises and not overworking my muscles.,0
24663,"If your overall goal is to lose weight, I would focus on diet before anything first. 

If you’re going from not exercising regularly to 6 days a week, that’s not going to be sustainable and you might find yourself demotivated. 

Maybe start with cardio only for about a month and then work in weight/body exercises once you’ve built your habit of working out.

You can’t just target the fat cells on one part of your body. Also, not sure if this is genetic, but you might be the type to gain fat in your stomach first before gaining it anywhere else on your body. I know that that’s the case for me. My stomach fat is more stubborn. This might also be because we’re female and the body naturally wants to hold on to fat, but I’m not sure. Personally, I’ve been going to the gym 5-6x a week for the last 4 months now. I have seen a significant change in my arms and legs, but not so much in my stomach. It just takes more time to lose stomach fat for me. You could also try ab exercises (sit ups/planks) &amp; make sure you have a caloric deficit.",0

It's been around for decades and no one has been able to come up with anything better. I'm currently on it myself, after a few years away from the gym. After 4 1/2 months of SS in the past, I was squatting 245x5,deadlifting 295x5, and benching 190x2 at a BW of 155lbs. You won't make that kind of progress anywhere else and people will notice.",0
24731,"Oh, well what kind of exercises do you recommend I do for optimal results?",0
24732,"Are you doing 60 reps a set, at once? That's not gonna do shit for you. Neither is 20. You need to do a weight you can lift between 5-12 times, and the lower end of that range from 5-8 is the sweet spot. Calisthenics will also get you in good shape but it takes much longer and you need a trainer to show you the different exercises (push-ups and sit-ups won't cut it).",0
24733,"This. Is. Awesome.

I love the plan: (1) eat at a calorie deficit (2) get moving (3) do those two over time and (4) profit",0

24735,The areas in which you want to be stronger. The decision is really up to you.,0
24736,Go to the doctor.,0
24737,Thanks I'll definitely try the eat more often thing as well as the sub,0
24738,"Thanks for the info, will take all this into consideration",0
24739,"A good friend of mine was always skinny, and part of it was because he couldn't fit all that much in his stomach per meal. Of course, eating more helps. Your stomach can literally expand and hold more.

Another good solution people think less about is to just eat more often. Have a snack between lunch and dinner, or add a protein shake to your lunch, etc. You don't have to stuff yourself til it hurts to eat more.

And, r/gainit may be helpful, too.",0
24740,"Firstly you are on the right track by working out and thinking about your diet. Keep it simple and Just try to eat in a calorie surplus and focus on the big five compound exercises to bulk up. The big five being: squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, and bent over rows. Also use a weight you can do 6-10 reps with. And the key to growth as a beginner is progressive overload, and time under tension. Again consistency and frequency is key. As a beginner, I would use a full body workout routine for the first year doing just the big five, or variations of the big five exercises, and do them 4 times a week. Rest and recovery are also key. Do your research online and find a program that you can do, and fits your lifestyle. If there is a takeaway from this, then it’s be consistent and train frequently; eat well, preferable more protein, and lift heavy stuff.",0
24741,"My dinners mostly consist of rice, I usually only eat a certain amount but I can try stomaching down mode than I usually do. That'll certainly help right?",0
24742,"You absolutely do need to up the diet to gain weight. Gains don't come from the weights, they come from food.

24746,"Might wanna see a PT if the problem persists for more than 2 weeks. There’s a lot going on where you describe, from hamstrings to quads to your LCL. I would look up biceps femoris light stretches and do general hamstring stretches. If that doesn’t help, or worsens, see a PT. In most states, physical therapists are direct access and they can see what insurance will cover (usually same as doctors visits % wise)",0

24757,Who is this kid giving all this advice? Why? What’s qualifications?,0
24759,"If you have access to machines that may be a good place to start. It can help build muscle memory that is used with free weights later.  


The best advice is to start light and be comfortable in the movement. 

Maybe 3 sets of 10, and if it is obvious that you can do 12 then do 12 and increase the weight for the next set.",0
24760,"all good dude, just spend the first year learning which you're already doing",0
24761,Congratulations,0
24762,"Still not completely understanding the question but I think you mean numbers? If so, that can vary alot. The weights will depend how strong you are at your start point and weather the program/selection of exercises is optimal for your body. 

For rep ranges, I would stay in the general 8-12 reps for 3-4ish working sets. Being a novice lifter, you will probably see great adaptations as long as you work hard and consistently. 

Hope that helps",0
24764,"You can do your own research, but Hula Hooping can provide a full body workout, it’s fun and it uses all of your muscle groups, especially your core.",0

24770,"Cool man, since you’ve done that already I’d recommend looking into “barbell medicine.” Specifically their free program “the bridge.” It’s meant to be the next step after the linear progression!",0
24771,"Ahh yes good ole mark Rippetoe...  I love listening to him. I did the StrongLifts 5x5 for a while, which was great but, like all programs you eventually move on. I was looking to change things up. I know you’re 100% correct as far as the muscles involved in squatting. So, I’ll keep the squatting while doing this round of program... I’ll revisit the starting strength series. I always learn something new when I listen to Rip anyway.",0
24772,"So, you’re right in thinking squats and deadlifts work your legs, however, they’re gonna work slightly different muscle in a different way. For example deadlifts work more the posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, paraspinals) whereas squats, in general, isolate the legs (quads, hamstring, glutes). And as you can see, there is definitely some cross over with what muscles are worked between the two exercises, however they’re different movements and work the muscles in different ways! I’d definitely recommend continuing w/ squats (as you’re doing)! 

I’d also recommend looking into “starting strength.” It’s a linear progression power lifting program where you do 3 movements a day 3 days a week going up in weight each day. It’s kind of what you’re doing now, but with more exercises and you’ll put strength on fast (upper and lower body). Lemme know what you think!",0
24773,"I was thinking the deadlifting works the legs out but to be clearer, I love squats and would never eliminate them. So maybe I should’ve further clarified. Don’t beat me 😂",0
24774,Why don't you think you need squats?,0
24775,It’s not really the amounts you eat it’s what you eat. Stick to the above and it will drop off you.,0

24782,"Start light, learn the motor pattern and work your way up. Your body is very resilient and can handle alot. 

What types of weight should you be using? I don't understand what you mean by the question. Barbells and dumbbells are great. Squat, Romanian deadlift, lunges, bicep curls, tricep extensions are all examples of exercises. Some more info about the question would be nice",0
24783,"Hey!

I understand the feeling of it becoming boring. I think it happens momentarily to most people at some point, and good for you for wanting to push through.  There are many types of programs, and the good ones should be catered to you and your goals.  Cookie cutter programs are fine, and most are typically fairly reliable, but they don't really take you into consideration.  With all of that said, the best program is the one you'll follow.  I could write you a great program, but if you don't enjoy it or are eager to get better and progress, then it's a worthless program.  It's important to find a style that you feel is good for you.  Many people talk down on CrossFit, (and at times it's easy to) but if you get a great coach and they are attentive to their students form, then go for it.  Give it a shot and see if it's something that you'll enjoy.  

Try Tabatta workouts, or insanity.  Some gyms offer more advanced circuit training classes, or TRX classes. Try them out and see what style fits you and your goals.",0

At the start of this year I began traveling a lot for work and now recently moved to a high elevation city. Lifting has become something that not necessarily boring to me but I definitely feel like I’m not in it anymore. I have thrown around the idea of joining a CrossFit gym to try something new, but I’m curious about your opinion here. Is there a way to nail down a good type of program (lifting, cross training, yoga, running, etc) for someone based on goals and interests?",0

your most important core muscle (transverse abdominis) essentially has 2 functions- stabilizing your spine along with all your internal organs, and FORCEFULLY exhaling air... if you poke yourself in the side of your gut and cough/laugh/sneeze you'll feel this muscle expand with a burst as you cough/laugh... your goal is to maintain that voluntarily as you do your exercises.... and then also practice maintaining it as you do things like drive, walk, fold laundry etc.... before long you'll catch yourself bracing your core without even thinking about it, it just becomes almost automatic just like when u cough/laugh.",0
24794,"good job, u are awesome",0
24795,"As others said can't target belly fat specifically, just gotta lose it overall. Good thing is that if you tend to stock it there then it'll also burn off faster than your other parts like your arm fat or wherever else.

24799,The question here really is did you start playing American football or real football as in soccer? If it is the latter you shouldn’t be having back issues.,0
24800,think u flipped the breathing tip lol... exhale on the concentric aspect (going up) inhale in the eccentric (going down),0
24801,"personally I'd suggest mat pilates over yoga for a back issue and core work... if you were never athletic chances are your core awareness isnt great at all, if u even know how to brace your core (dont worry I see people every day who think sucking in their stomach is bracing their core)... I've been a weight lifter my whole life and work in orthopedic physical therapy... most yogis I see are weak as hell  where pilates people are generally much more well rounded physically, in general of course",0
24802,"this plus try doing some squats, lunges, sidesteps with theraband, clams with theraband, bridges, do all these 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps max (those last few reps should be a struggle, if not ur not lifting heavy enough).

most meat heads are super nice people, especially if you're talking about weights!!",0
24807,"To be honest I think you’re right with the back injury, strange how it disappears during exercise though, however could be serotonin/adrenaline I suppose. 

Walking does seem to help ease the pain; I work in a office so sitting down all day then going out sprinting around probably is not a great combo. 

Cheers!",0
24808,"I’ll take a look at those mat Pilates motions, cheers!  I’ve been doing a bit of yoga as I thought it might help... does the way I breathe effect my core during exercise?",0
24809,"just going by that info, I'd guess your core awareness needs some work. basically you may know how to ""brace your core"" but you're likely not using it functionally when running and doing sports... in my 10+ years treating back pain in physical therapy that's the MOST common thing I see in ppl with low back issues


in a nutshell, look up engaging your transverse (mat pilates exercises essentially) and practice maintaining maximal contraction while breathing, then add in some dynamic mat pilates motions (dying bug exercise for example or something easier)",0

24812,"I'm not a doctor, but from the brief description you've given that sounds like a possible back injury. I'd recommend talking to a doctor if it doesn't start to improve within a month. alter your routines to things like long walks (2+ miles), yoga, swimming, bike riding, elliptical workouts and other low impact forms of exercise and avoid things like weight lifting, running/sprinting, and anything else that might exacerbate an existing back injury. Again, not a doctor, just a jack-wagon who found out the hard way that dead-lifts and degenerative disk disease don't get along well.",0
24813,"I can’t/rarely do treadmills either, good thing you don’t need to use a treadmill in order to get the benefits of walking. Just walk, even slow walking is good. To start with aim for 10,000 steps a day. That will help reduce some excess fat, but mostly you have to stop overeating. You cannot maintain nor add to excess fat without taking in more calories than you burn. 

You also can’t really target burning off fat in certain areas of the body. Think of your body like a swimming pool. Do you think you could go to one end of the pool and take out a cup of water, but only that end would be affected? No, the pool in the water would level out all over. Bodies, like pools, are shaped differently, so some people have excess fat deposited more in some places than others, but no matter how you’re shaped, your body will take off fat all over.",0

One day I'm riding across no problem. Now I struggle with a quarter mile and the more or-of-shape I get the harder it gets. Doctors say everything is fine and I should be able to exercise, but I do struggle with it. I completely understand wanting to love exercise and not being able to.

Starting out exercise is always hard and painful. If you're sure you're not being a wimp, please don't be too proud to see a doctor. There could be a fixable medical reason for your discomfort, such as a nutritional deficiency. 

I'm also not sure what your weight is; starting out exercise is unfortunately more painful for more overweight people. In which case, just go slow! No pride in starting out too fast and getting injured because of what you feel you ""should"" be doing.",0

If your gym has a sauna or steam room that could be a chance to try to acclimate yourself to it separately from exercise which might positively help when training.",0
24857,"Honestly, this is probably the best answer. Everyone else is talking about taking it easy, but you said even walking is hard on your chest. It sounds like there may actually be something wrong.",0
24858,You might need some carbs and protein/fat if you’re feeling nauseous. Could be wrong but i have issues with low blood sugar when working out. Maybe take blood sugar before and after the workout? Not sure about the chest thing. Do you wear a smart watch or something that tells you your heart rate? Might be something you need to know. A way to ease into exercise is something like couch to 5 k. You walk for 5 mins for warm up. Then run for 30 seconds. Walk 30 seconds then back and forth for 10 mins and then cool down walk for 5. I think it changes every week and gets you in better shape but honestly start monitoring some things or/and see a doctor. If nothing is wrong it might be anxiety.,0
24859,"First thing you have to do is see a doctor and rule out any possible underlying medical conditions that could be causing/contributing to symptoms (severe chest discomfort, flushed, etc).

Second, hydration. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Drink water before the work out and throughout the day. Eat afterwards.

Third, nutrition. More fruits and veggies, less processed food.

Fourth, find a workout you actually enjoy and look forward to. Try out different activities. Find a run club. Try orangetheory, Crossfit, whatever fitness trend that will give you a free trial.

Good luck and great job even showing up to the gym!",0
24860,How many different types of exercise have you tried? Do you ever work out shortly after eating?,0
24861,"When I was young I would always feel this way. Always trying to lift more than I could, impress people that don’t know me. As I got older, I realized that no one cares. Everyone is doing their own thing. 

But I know the feeling. What I would do when I was anxious or uncertain is just get on the treadmill or elliptical until I found an open machine that I was comfortable with and could stay at for a little. This allowed me time to figure out what I was going to do next without feeling pressured.

24866,"Lots of people feel that way in relation to working out.  Starting out slowly, with short sessions, helped me to get back into the habit.

Have you tried any other classes besides Zumba or fitness studios? Some people find that having an instructor guiding you through the workout makes it more productive than working out by yourself at the gym. 

You are on the right track by realizing that exercise is critical to good health.  The trick might be finding the right type of workout activity.

For me, OrangeTheory Fitness has transformed me into a daily workout person.  The classes have exercises for beginners and there is a no-judgment atmosphere.  Just do the best you can.  Like you, I felt horrible after the first few workouts because I was out of shape.  I started slowly by just going twice a week, doing what I could.  After about three weeks, I could see improvement and increased the number of classes.  You just need to push through that adjustment period.

It seems you are very focused on building an upper body but you are somewhat focused on minor muscles ie biceps. If you want my advice, I’d start off with a simple 5 x 5 exercise program such as Stronglifts to deliver a full body workout. In my personal experience, unless you are becoming a bodybuilder, you can work the body pretty well in only 5-6 movements with exercises such as squats, deadlifts, shoulder press, bench press and row. Add some planks or renegade rows to really work your core. Alternate between upper and lower body exercises. Works really well with dumbbells too. 

Today I did dumbbell circuits involving thrusters, deadlifts, pushups, renegade rows, lunges with a curl and mountain climbers/burpee combo and I’m feeling it. Keep it simple stupid. Work your big muscles for the calorie burn and focus on small muscles as a secondary concern.",0
24874,"To add: I ALWAYS drink 2-4 cups of water during/after a workout so hydration shouldn’t be an issue. Unless I need electrolytes through Powerade or something. 

I am caffeine sensitive so it’s big no-no to coffee, pre-workouts, etc.",0
24875,"I think you have to analyze yourself, you have to determine what it is that really bothers you about going to the gym.

Maybe if you aren't sure about how certain machines work, just don't use those machines, or ask someone how it works. Whatever it is, figure it out, address it, solve it, get over it. You can do it.  
On a somewhat related note. I read a thing about having a cold bath/shower. It's suppose to help with managing stress. It's suppose to make you think - if I can do that I can do anything. Maybe give that a try. Wake up and have a cold shower, better than coffee for waking you up. :)",0

Search beginner full body work out plan, and take some time to analyse the movements.

And if that is too much for now, just go straight to the treadmill, walk for half an hour (maybe with a few inclines), and go home. Doesn't seem like much, but it will help with getting used to the people and the room.

24899,"No one cares about you. Sounds harsh, but they're more worried about their own gains or fixing their form so they don't fuck something up. So stop caring about them and be selfish...do it for you.",0
24900,"First off, all exercise is safe if you progress properly and could injure you if you neglect proper form. Running will beat your knees up and swimming will get the shoulders. Both are unlikely if you progress intelligently. So, if you spend a few weeks running and slowly up the mileage/time, your body adapts. On the other hand, if you’ve never gone running and decide to start at 5 miles. You’ll probably have an issue. 
With that said regarding your question, I would recommend body weight exercises for you. Body weight training will foster better body composition since being lighter/more muscle makes pull-ups/pushups/everything easier. Start with pushups, pull-ups (horizontal rows if you’re not able to perform pull-ups), bodyweight squats pike presses, lunges, laying leg raises, planks, and bicycles. After a few weeks/months, progress to different variations to make them more difficult or work for endurance. Some exercises to avoid for a while are hanging leg raises, muscle ups, and dips.",0

24922,"Weight loss is the only answer. It doesn't matter what exercises you're doing, as long as you are doing them. Target exercises will build muscle in a specific area, but they don't reduce fat in that area. Fat is lost more or less proportionately across your whole body, you don't get to pick where it comes from. In order to make your legs slimmer, you'll have to make your whole body slimmer.


The key here is to expend more energy than you consume, so you'll want to start by getting your diet under control. I don't reccomend ""dieting"" because diets are temporary, and so are their results. The best way is to slowly cut out the bad, and replace it with the good. Adding an exercise regiment will help, but neither exercise nor diet alone are enough to make a difference. You can't out run your fork, and you can't under eat and expect to stay healthy. 

The best exercises, in my personal opinion, are full body strength and cardio exercises. Personally, I love HIIT. Kettlebell squats, mountain climbers, pushups, and burpees all fit the bill for both strength and cardio, and they'll get your heart rate up and expend lots of energy. 

A great place to start for beginners is the 7 Minute Workout app. The workouts are hard, but they're not very long, so you should be able to complete them, even if you can't necessarily keep up with the instructor. They give you a good idea of how hard you need to work to actually burn a reasonable amount of calories.",0

I'm a bit confused with the question. 

If you're asking if I like KBs as a cardio workout, no.  KB swings aren't exactly considered cardio workouts, although they are tiring and you can do a high number of reps, swings aren't really used as a supplemental form to cycling, or swimming, or running. 

If you're asking if swings are a better form of cardio than traditional weight training, then perhaps.  But a clean and jerk is a better approach for what you may be wanting to accomplish. 

If you asking with the idea of not wanting to use traditional cardio exercises, but use something weighted instead, then maybe.  But I don't know if swings will positively affect VO2 max, blood pressure, cardiac output, your RER, or some other readings the same way traditional cardio can.",0
24948,"Oh man, thanks for the question, but there is a lot to unwrap here.  

First off, you're still only 16, you have a long way to go until you're ""older"". Also, your flexibility and balance may be off due to your ever changing body right now.  

This conversation would take over an hour to have, so if there is anything I could tell you, I'd give you these 5 points:

1. Stretch daily.
2. Take another rest day.
3. Make sure you can just do the core lifts, bench, squat, deadlift with great form. Don't worry about the weight yet, just keep your body moving and lifting correctly for now. 
4. Incorporate some cardio.
5. You're still young and your body is adapting to your physical changes. Please don't be overly concerned with your looks, enjoy time with your family and your friends. And use the gym in moderation like everything else.

You're not going to hurt bones from lifting unless you smash a weight on it. 

Google how to do an exercise:

Squat
Deadlift
Bench press also dumbell bench
Etc..

Start out light and work your way up. Injuries happen from doing too much weight too soon and improper form. 

Also you will not lose weight if your diet is bad, usually what happens is you'll start lifting weights and overeat because your body will be hungrier. So eat lean foods, typical body builder diet:

Chicken breast

Lean beef

Sweet potato

Veggies of all kinds

Fruit of all kinds

Protein powder

I am wondering what I can do to make my workouts more effective, as with the weakness of my upper body I have a hard time completing a full range of motion with certain workouts like push-ups and dips, as well as certain core and glute exercises requiring a suspended leg as my terrible flexibility prevents me from bringing my leg up or in enough to the extent needed for good form. Also, sometimes when exercising, I get light-headed and despite having good balance, there are certain exercises that even throw me off my footing. Another thing is how to maintain a healthy diet when I can't control what healthy or unhealthy foods get brought into the house and how to drink more water more effectively without or reducing the gain of water weight. Lastly, I wanted to know if I should eat something light before or after exercising (I exercise at night from 7 pm to 8 pm) and what foods to look for when building muscle that are easily accessible.",0
24981,I follow the keto diet and do circuit training workouts such as Jillian michaels and Rebecca Louise. I order a lot of low carb foods online so I don’t feel deprived. Keep your carb intake low and stay committed to your workouts and those pounds will fall off in no time!,0

24983,"If you have central fat distribution it will be the last place to go and first to grow if you gain. At both very underweight and slightly overweight BMIs I have always looked a pregnant but my upper body is skin and bones. 

The best thing to do is strength/resistance as well as cardio. Toning up core muscle groups helps, cardio alone won’t be enough. 

Btw I did have a 6 pack when I was doing gymnastics and diving which is all about core work and endurance. Only time my tummy was ever flat. But it took a lot of training so you have to work hard for it, especially if that’s not your natural body shape.",0
24984,Are you drinking enough? You have to really be on top of your hydration when working out.,0
24985,&amp; HGH ahah,0
24986,"As the top comment said, it’s impossible to cut fat from certain areas. It’s just about being in a constant calorie deficit.",0
24988,"Unfortunately, we can't really determine where we'll lose fat; it's genetically pre-set. You'll eventually lose body fat all over if you keep going, though, and you are right to be proud of your progress so far! Keep going! :)",0
24989,Yeah and if you are going hard you can squeal loudly but not for the entire duration of the exercise,0
24991,Thanks. Attempting to burn fat and build muscle. Just trying to be healthy,0
24992,"Don't worry about the amount of calories burned. Everyone is different. The only thing you can control is your diet and exercise. Keep it up, you got this.",0

24994,Yeah sure give me a sec,0
24995,"I’m glad, keep grinding!!",0
24996,"I just do both and if anyone asks I say I’m leanbulking and then say the words hypertrophy, VO2 max, and subcutaneous in any particular order with grunts and mumbling mixed in",0
24998,Exactly my man. Way too many people give up because they don’t see abs right away or their muscles aren’t huge after a week. Thats not how it works and you seem to know that which is half the battle. You’ve made some great progress so just keep going and you’ll get there. I’ll be looking out for that pic with abs at some point though!,0
24999,No offence taken my friend,0
